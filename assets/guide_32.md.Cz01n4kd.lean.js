Test the amber with nail polish remover containing acetone.","completion":"When shopping for amber, it is important to exercise caution to ensure you purchase a genuine and high-quality product. As one of the most sought-after gemstones on the market, amber can be difficult to distinguish from other materials that may be passed off as the real deal. Here are some tips to help you shop for amber like a pro. Firstly, consider the color of the amber. Amber comes in a range of colors, including pale yellow, orange, brown, and even green. However, it is the opaque and cloudy amber that is most valuable. Beware of overly clear and bright amber, which may indicate it has been treated or is not genuine. Secondly, expect to see veins and inclusions in the amber. These are natural imperfections that add to the beauty and uniqueness of the stone. If the amber looks too perfect or flawless, it may not be real. Thirdly, perform a float test on the amber. This involves placing the stone in a glass of water. Genuine amber will float due to its low density, while imitations such as plastic or glass will sink. Fourthly, try the hot needle test. Heat up a needle or pin and gently press it against an inconspicuous part of the amber. The heat should create a tiny burn mark and the area will smell like burnt pine. If the mark does not appear, the amber may be synthetic. Finally, test the amber with nail polish remover containing acetone. Apply a small amount of the remover to a hidden part of the amber and see if it reacts. Genuine amber will not be affected by acetone, but imitations made using plastic or other materials will begin to dissolve. In conclusion, shopping for amber requires a discerning eye and a bit of testing. By considering the color, looking for natural imperfections, performing the float and hot needle tests, and testing with nail polish remover, you can help ensure you purchase a genuine and high-quality piece of amber."},{"prompt":"Answer a question about this article: As an important railroad and road junction and production center, Hanover was a major target for strategic bombing during World War II, including the Oil Campaign.

In fact, he once described an actor as having a \\"cruel and destructive streak,\\" which is quite an insult in the acting world. The diary entries that contain the above statement have recently been bought by the British Library for £320,000. It is unknown which actor Sir Alec was referring to, but it is clear that these diary entries contain some juicy drama that is of interest to the public. In addition to the cruel and destructive streak comment, Sir Alec also noted a moment where Sir Laurence Olivier snubbed his wife of 45 years. The details of this snub are unknown, but it is clear that it was enough to bother Sir Alec and make it into his diary. Overall, these diary entries provide a fascinating insight into the personal lives of some of the most famous actors of the time.

Mom forces daughter to eat vegetables and get ready for bed. Expert advises parents to play with kids after arriving home. Also it's easier for nannies to discipline kids because they're not the moms. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"As a parent, it's natural to want to spend as much time as possible with your child, but sometimes situations arise that require outside help, like hiring a nanny. Although it's common to feel jealous when someone spends more time with your child than you do, it's important to remember that nannies can be an essential part of your family's support system. One of the reasons for jealousy can stem from feeling like the nanny is doing a better job of parenting than the mother. For example, fighting over vegetables at dinner or getting ready for bed can be a continuous struggle, but a nanny may have an easier time handling these tasks since they're not the primary caregiver. The best approach is to communicate with your nanny and establish a routine that works for everyone. Experts also stress that parents should prioritize quality time with their children. Playing with your child after you come home from work is a simple yet effective way to bond and strengthen your relationship with them. Lastly, it's important to remember that nannies can serve as teachers and role models for your children. They may have a different approach to discipline, but that doesn't mean it's any less effective. In fact, allowing your nanny to discipline your child can also help establish boundaries and promote respect. In conclusion, hiring a nanny can be a great decision for your family, but it's important to prioritize open communication and establish a routine that works for everyone. Remember to make the most of the time you have with your child and trust that your nanny has your child's best interests at heart."},{"prompt":"the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? also happens to be the movie 's most admirable quality OPTIONS: negative positive","completion":"positive"},{"prompt":"After my last interraction with him , I had decided that he told me the truth and really did n't have any issue with me .

However, discussing this issue can be uncomfortable and difficult. Fortunately, there are some things you can do to make the conversation more productive and less stressful. First, be okay with feeling uncomfortable. This is a tough conversation to have, but avoiding it will not make the problem disappear. Rather than putting it off or avoiding it altogether, choose a time to talk when you are both relaxed and undistracted. When you do initiate the conversation, approach him in compassion, not judgment. It’s important to let him know that you care about him and that you recognize that addiction is a complex issue. Tell him how his drinking affects you, but avoid placing blame. Use “I” statements instead of “you” statements. For example, instead of saying “you always drink too much,” say “when you drink, I feel worried and anxious.” It’s also important to ask your husband to get treatment. Many people try to force their partner to quit drinking or go to rehab immediately, but this often leads to resistance and defensiveness. Instead, start the conversation by expressing your concern and asking him if he would be willing to get help. This gives him the chance to make the decision himself and take ownership of it. While it is important to have the conversation, it’s important to avoid creating an action plan right away. This may seem counterintuitive, but it’s best to give your husband some time to process what you’ve said and come to his own decision about seeking treatment. This is a big decision and may require some thought and preparation. Remember, change takes time and it’s important to be patient and supportive throughout the process. In conclusion, discussing your husband’s drinking problem can be challenging, but it’s an important step in helping him get the help he needs. By approaching him with compassion, avoiding blame and demands, and giving him the time and space to process his decision, you can create a productive and supportive conversation that can lead to positive change."},{"prompt":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: The 2016 MBC Entertainment Awards () presented by Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC), took place on December 29, 2016 at MBC Public Hall in Sangamdong, Mapogu, Seoul.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Several major airports in the United States have experienced significant delays on numerous flights, causing frustration and inconvenience for passengers traveling on Monday. New York's JFK Airport has been hit particularly hard, with wait times exceeding two hours on 56 flights while passengers on 14 flights had to wait more than three hours. Meanwhile, Miami International saw delays of more than two hours on 51 flights. The reasons behind the delays are not clear, but it is believed that the bad weather conditions, security checks, and an increase in the number of people traveling for the winter holidays may have contributed to the situation. Passengers took to social media to share their frustration and anger, with many expressing disappointment at the lack of communication from airlines and airport staff regarding the cause of the delays. Traveling can already be a stressful experience, but long delays can quickly turn it into a nightmare. In addition to the inconvenience, these delays can also have financial consequences for passengers who may miss connecting flights or business meetings. As a result, airlines and airport authorities need to take steps to ensure that passengers are informed of the reasons behind the delays and are assisted as much as possible. While JFK and Miami International were the hardest hit, other airports including LAX and O'Hare International in Chicago have also experienced delays. As such, passengers need to remain vigilant and keep track of any updates from their airlines or airport authorities. In conclusion, the recent delays at major US airports highlight the importance of communication and assistance for passengers during such situations.

Daly, who had also faced his own marital problems, offered his support to Woods and said that he did not need to apologize to the media for the mistakes he made. Daly, who has always been a vocal critic of the media, even went so far as to say that the media should “get off his back” and let him focus on the game.

All you need is a few basic supplies and a little bit of patience, and you can create your own beautiful and unique wrist accessory. Here is a simple step-by-step guide to making a cord bracelet. First, gather your supplies. You will need a length of cord, scissors, and a ruler or tape measure. Fold your cord in half and tie a knot at the folded end. This will create a loop that you will use to fasten the bracelet later. Measure the length of the bracelet by wrapping the cord around your wrist and adding an extra inch or two for the knot and fastening loop. Turn the bracelet so that the loop is at the top, and the two loose strands are hanging down. Take the left strand and pull it around the right side of the bracelet, weaving it in and out of the other strand as you go. Once you reach the end of the bracelet, take the loose right strand and weave it in and out of the left strand. Pull the right strand up through the left loop, and tighten up the knot by pulling on both strands. Repeat this weaving and knotting process all the way to the other end of the bracelet. Once you reach the end, tie a final knot to secure the bracelet. Finally, trim off any excess cord with scissors, and your bracelet is ready to wear. That's it!

The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats.

In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI, and NIRS.

Judge Hans-Joachim Eckert shocked the world when he criticized England's 2018 bid to host the World Cup. In addition, Qatar was named as the host for the upcoming 2022 event, while Russia was chosen to host the 2018 edition. Many people were outraged by the decisions made, as they believed them to be unjust. The FIFA report has also come under criticism from the chairman of the Football Association (FA), Greg Dyke. He described the report as \\"a joke\\" and raised concerns about the organization's transparency. These remarks are a reflection of the growing dissatisfaction among fans and officials with the way FIFA is running things. Furthermore, the FBI has stepped up its investigation into the alleged corruption, causing even more trouble for the organization. The investigation has led to concerns that FIFA is not carrying out its duties with integrity and that the fans are being let down. The allegations of corruption are not new, as they have plagued FIFA for several years. However, it is clear that the organization has not effectively dealt with the issue. The recent developments only serve to highlight the growing concern about the transparency and accountability of FIFA.

Even as the iPad was flying off shelves in 2010, his children weren't allowed to have one.","completion":"In today's world, digital devices are a ubiquitous aspect of modern life. From smartphones to tablets, people of all ages are using digital technologies. However, some notable figures have recognized the potential downsides of unrestricted device usage, even for young children. One famous example is Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple. Despite his professional involvement in the development of devices like the iPad, Jobs and his wife, Laurene Powell, were quite strict about screen time for their children. Erin and Eve, their two daughters, didn't get to use digital devices much despite the release of the iPad in 2010. This decision reflects a growing concern among parents and educators about the effects of too much screen time on children. Some studies have suggested that excessive screen time can lead to issues such as attention problems, sleep disturbances, and delayed language development. Too much screen time may also negatively impact children's social and emotional well-being, as well as their physical health. While many parents feel pressure to give their children access to the latest digital devices, it's worth considering the potential long-term impact of such decisions. In recent years, some experts have suggested guidelines for healthy device usage, such as limiting screen time to certain hours of the day or setting aside specific times for device-free activities. Ultimately, it's up to individual families to make decisions about device usage that work best for them. However, the example of Steve Jobs and his family serves as a reminder that it's important to be mindful about the role of digital devices in our lives, particularly when it comes to young children who may be especially vulnerable to their effects."},{"prompt":"Sentence: The Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport is in Paracuellos de Jarama.

Vincent I, on the other hand, died on September 13, 1822, at the age of 55. Therefore, it is evident that Vincent I died before Francis IV. Francis IV was the last Duke of Modena and Reggio, and his reign was characterized by political upheavals and economic struggles. He is remembered for being a patron of the arts and sciences, despite the challenges facing his administration. Vincent I, on the other hand, was a ruler of Portugal and the Algarves during the early 19th century. He was known for his efforts to modernize the country and improve its economy. However, his reign was short-lived, and he died before he could realize many of his goals for the country. In conclusion, historical evidence shows that Vincent I died before Francis IV.

Customs found £674,920 at London City Airport in 2009. More than £400k was in used notes bundled in elastic bands, court heard. Judge ordered it be forfeited as 'proceeds of criminal activity' Dr Wiese now appealing to High Court over claims there is 'no evidence' of wrongdoing.","completion":"Christoffel Hendrik Wiese, a South African businessman, is currently appealing to the High Court to return a stash of money that was seized at London City Airport by customs officials in 2009. The money, totaling £674,920, was discovered by customs officials who found that more than £400k was bundled in elastic bands and in used notes. However, in 2017, a judge ordered that the money be forfeited as \\"proceeds of criminal activity\\". Wiese is now appealing this decision, claiming that there is \\"no evidence\\" of wrongdoing and that the money is entirely legitimate. The case raises questions surrounding the accountability and transparency of law enforcement officials when it comes to seizing large sums of money. In many cases, individuals whose money is seized have little recourse to challenge the decision, leaving them in a difficult position. Wiese's case is particularly interesting because of the lack of evidence of wrongdoing. While it is possible that the money could have been obtained through illegal means, the fact that no evidence has been presented is troubling. Without a strong body of evidence to support the forfeiture of the money, it raises the question of whether the decision was based on assumptions rather than facts. This case also highlights the importance of due process and the need for officials to follow proper procedures when seizing assets. If there is evidence of criminal activity, then it is important that the individuals responsible are held accountable. However, if there is no evidence, then it is equally important that the money is returned to its rightful owner. Overall, the outcome of Wiese's appeal will have important implications for future cases involving the seizure of assets. It is imperative that officials act in a transparent and fair manner, with strong evidence to support their decisions. Failure to do so will erode trust in law enforcement and undermine the rule of law."},{"prompt":"Portugal: Portugal (Portuguese: [puɾtuˈɣaɫ]), officially the Portuguese Republic (Portuguese: República Portuguesa), is a country on the Iberian Peninsula, in Southwestern Europe.

One theory is that the calendar came from mathematical operations based on the numbers thirteen and twenty, which were important numbers to the Maya. The numbers multiplied together equal 260. Another theory is that the 260day period came from the length of human pregnancy. This is close to the average number of days between the first missed menstrual period and birth, unlike Naegele's rule which is 40 weeks between the last menstrual period and birth. It is postulated that midwives originally developed the calendar to predict babies' expected birth dates. A third theory comes from understanding of astronomy, geography and paleontology. The mesoamerican calendar probably originated with the Olmecs, and a settlement existed at Izapa, in southeast Chiapas Mexico, before 1200 BCE.

However, Hubbard and Kelley have their sights set on something different: collaborating with rappers Lil Wayne or Wiz Khalifa. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Hubbard and Kelley shared their desire to push boundaries and break down barriers in the music industry. \\"Music evolves, and we like to be on the cutting edge,\\" says Hubbard. They recognize that country music, much like any other genre, must adapt and change with the times in order to remain relevant. Their desire to collaborate with rappers is not entirely surprising, considering the popularity of country-rap crossovers such as \\"Old Town Road\\" by Lil Nas X featuring Billy Ray Cyrus. However, what sets Florida Georgia Line apart is their willingness to experiment with different sounds and styles in their own music. Their latest album, Can't Say I Ain't Country, features a range of musical styles, from the traditional country twang of \\"Women\\" to the hip-hop infused beats of \\"Colorado.\\" This willingness to experiment has earned the duo both praise and criticism, with some traditional country fans accusing them of straying too far from the genre's roots. But Florida Georgia Line remains undeterred, continuing to push boundaries and experiment with new sounds. In their own words, they are simply \\"having fun making music and letting the fans be the judge.\\" As the country music industry continues to evolve and transform, it's clear that Florida Georgia Line will play a significant role in shaping its future. With their desire to collaborate with rappers and their willingness to experiment with different sounds and styles, there's no telling where their music will take them next.

As you may be aware, our company has experienced a high turnover rate in recent months. The negative effects of this situation have become apparent and include loss of valuable intellectual assets, reduced productivity, and increased recruitment and training costs. In light of these facts, I propose the implementation of employee retention programs, including: 1. Employee Compensation and Benefits Review 2. Employee Recognition Programs 3. Career Development Opportunities 4. Employee Feedback Surveys 5. Work-life Balance Support Programs These initiatives, if implemented correctly, will significantly impact employee morale, motivation, and job satisfaction. Consistently, employee satisfaction will lead to a decrease in employee turnover rates and an improvement in overall organizational performance. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss these ideas with you and look forward to your feedback. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, [Your Name]"},{"prompt":"When comparing different documents, or witnesses, of a single, original text, the observed differences are called variant readings, or simply variants or readings. It is not always apparent which single variant represents the author's original work. The process of textual criticism seeks to explain how each variant may have entered the text, either by accident (duplication or omission) or intention (harmonization or censorship), as scribes or supervisors transmitted the original author's text by copying it. The textual critic's task, therefore, is to sort through the variants, eliminating those most likely to be unoriginal, hence establishing a critical text, or critical edition, that is intended to best approximate the original. At the same time, the critical text should document variant readings, so the relation of extant witnesses to the reconstructed original is apparent to a reader of the critical edition. In establishing the critical text, the textual critic considers both external evidence (the age, provenance, and affiliation of each witness) and internal or physical considerations (what the author and scribes, or printers, were likely to have done). Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply unanswerable): When do variations enter a witness text?","completion":"Variations enter a witness text either by accident (duplication or omission) or intention (harmonization or censorship), as scribes or supervisors transmitted the original author's text by copying it."},{"prompt":"diverse nisula 150e maskinhandel.dk second hand tractors and farming equipment Please write the text above using proper case.","completion":"Diverse Nisula 150E - Maskinhandel.dk - Second Hand Tractors and Farming Equipment."},{"prompt":"What is the answer: Actress Dakota Johnson is the daughter of actor Don Johnson and which actress?","completion":"Melanie Griffith."},{"prompt":"Q: What department stores merged to form Macy's?

Use charcoal Use appropriate paper. Get a drawing stump. Get an eraser.","completion":"When it comes to drawing, there are a few basic tools that every artist should have in their arsenal. Pencils, pens, charcoal, appropriate paper, drawing stumps, and erasers are a few of the essentials that can help you create the artwork you envision. Pencils are one of the most basic drawing tools, but they are also one of the most versatile. There are different types of pencils available, ranging from hard to soft lead. If you want to create light and airy sketches, a hard-lead pencil may be the right choice. For bolder and darker strokes, a soft-lead pencil is best. Experiment with different leads and find out what works best for you. Pens are also useful for drawing, especially when you want to create sharp, precise lines. There are a variety of pens available, including fine point pens for detailed work, and brush pens for a more expressive style. Having a few pens on hand can help you create different effects in your drawing. Charcoal is another drawing tool that can create a unique look in your artwork. It's great for creating dramatic effects, but it can be messy. Make sure to work on an appropriate surface and have a clean workspace when using charcoal. Choosing the right paper is also important for effective drawing. Different types of paper have different textures and weights, which can affect how your artwork turns out. For example, smooth paper works well with pens, while textured paper is good for charcoal drawings. Experiment with different paper types and find out what works best for the type of artwork you're creating. A drawing stump is a tool that can help you blend and soften your drawings. It's useful for creating smooth transitions between different tones in your artwork. With a little bit of practice, a drawing stump can help you achieve a more professional look in your artwork. Finally, having an eraser on hand is crucial for correcting mistakes and tweaking details in your drawing. Make sure to use a high-quality eraser, as some erasers can damage your paper or smudge your artwork. In conclusion, by making use of pencils, pens, charcoal, appropriate paper, drawing stumps, and erasers, you can achieve great results in your artwork. With practice and experimentation, you can develop your own unique style and technique as an artist."},{"prompt":"Data: Aaron Deer, genre, Indie rock; Indie rock, stylisticOrigin, Garage rock; Aaron Deer, instrument, Keyboard instrument Sentence about the following d","completion":"Aaron Deer is an indie rock musician who plays keyboard and incorporates elements of garage rock into his style."},{"prompt":"Review: is an actress works as well as it does because ( the leads ) are such a companionable couple Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?

Reserve several titles.","completion":"When it comes to writing content, it's easy to overlook the significance of the title. However, it's worth recognizing that titles are just as important as the body of the content itself. A compelling title can grab the reader's attention and encourage them to click or read on, while a poor title can cause readers to lose interest before they've even begun. One essential tip for crafting the right title is to keep a list of potential titles. Brainstorming a wide range of ideas can help you compare and contrast different titles and find the one that best fits your content's tone, voice, and purpose. Don't be afraid to recruit help. Asking colleagues or friends for their input can help you get a fresh perspective on your titles while providing valuable feedback on which ones are the most appealing. Finally, reserve several titles. Sometimes, what might seem like a fantastic title initially can lose its luster over time. By reserving several titles, you can ensure that you have backup options if your first choice doesn't feel appropriate further down the line. In conclusion, while it's easy to focus on the meat of your content, don't overlook the importance of crafting the perfect title. By keeping a list of potential titles, recruiting help, and reserving several options, you can create a title that truly captures the essence of your content and persuades readers to engage with your work."},{"prompt":"Solve 19*y + 8076 10666 = 138*y + 6216 for y.","completion":"Simplifying both sides, we get: 19*y + 8076 - 10666 = 138*y + 6216 Combine like terms: 19*y - 138*y = 6216 - 8076 + 10666 -119*y = 2376 Divide both sides by -119: y = -20.

Make corrections for index error, dip, refraction, semidiameter, and parallax. Add or subtract the declination of the sun to find your latitude.","completion":"To accurately find your latitude using the sun’s position, you need to take into account various corrections. First, determine the sun’s angle of elevation at its highest point. This can be done using a sextant or an astrolabe. However, the instrument you use must be adjusted for index error, which can cause inaccuracies in your measurement. Next, you need to correct for dip. Dip is caused by the curvature of the Earth and affects the positioning of the sun as seen from your location. The amount of dip correction needed depends on the height of your observation point above sea level. Refraction also affects the position of the sun, causing it to appear higher than it actually is. This is because the Earth’s atmosphere bends the sun’s light as it travels towards us. A correction can be applied to account for refraction. The sun’s semi-diameter also needs to be taken into consideration. This is the angle that represents the size of the sun’s disk. Although small, it can affect your measurement when using an instrument such as a sextant. Finally, parallax correction is needed to account for the fact that the sun’s position appears to shift slightly as you move closer or further away from it. This correction is only necessary when using an instrument with a telescope. Once you have made all the necessary corrections, you can add or subtract the declination of the sun to determine your latitude. Declination is the angular distance between the sun and the celestial equator, which changes throughout the year. Tables and charts are available to help determine the declination for a specific date. In conclusion, finding your latitude using the sun's position requires a precise measurement and the application of various corrections. However, with the right equipment and knowledge, it is a reliable method that has been used for centuries."},{"prompt":"First question: Which one is better: Quora or Yahoo Answers?

Garden salad (6) was made with rusty, wilty lettuce, carrots were stale. Nothing in it was fresh. Lasagna check out my pic. I was expecting a luscious, beautiful, hearty, homemade hunk of wellmade lasagna (for 10). During this lunch service, only two other tables were occupied in the resto, but still my server couldn't get things off the ground. We spent the next 45 minutes trying to deal with one thing after another: funky new dressing, funky salad which he accidentally charged for as it was a swap for the pasta, we ordered a meatball but no meatball arrived, waited another 20 minutes for that lasagna to get boxed up, etc...

Talk to your doctor about stopping the medication or switching it out. Discuss aripiprazole for use as an antipsychotic medication.","completion":"Prescription medications are an important aspect of managing certain health conditions, but it’s equally essential to take them as directed and under the supervision of a healthcare professional. It's not uncommon for individuals to continue taking medications they no longer need or that are no longer effective, which can lead to unnecessary side effects or interactions with other drugs. Therefore, it's crucial to check your prescription medications regularly and talk to your doctor about whether you should stop or change the medication. If you are taking antipsychotic medications or have a mental health condition that requires them, it may be helpful to discuss aripiprazole with your doctor. Aripiprazole is an antipsychotic medication that can help manage symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression associated with bipolar disorder. It works by regulating the levels of dopamine and serotonin in the brain, which can reduce hallucinations, delusions, and mood swings. Studies have shown that aripiprazole is effective in treating various mental health conditions and has fewer side effects compared to other antipsychotic medications. It's important to note that aripiprazole is not suitable for everyone, and your doctor will consider your medical history and any other medications you're taking before recommending it. If you're experiencing side effects from your current medication, or it's no longer effective, contact your healthcare professional. They will conduct an assessment of your current symptoms and may recommend switching to a different medication, such as aripiprazole. However, never stop taking your medication without consulting your healthcare professional as abruptly stopping some medications, particularly antipsychotics, can lead to severe withdrawal symptoms. In summary, checking your prescription medications regularly and discussing them with your doctor can help ensure that you're taking the right medication for your health condition. Aripiprazole is an antipsychotic medication that can be a safe and effective alternative to other antipsychotics. If you're experiencing side effects or it's no longer effective, talk to your healthcare professional, as they may recommend switching to a different medication."},{"prompt":"AP About threequarters of potential jurors in the Kobe Bryant sexual assault case have already been told whether to return to the courthouse later this week for more questioning, putting the selection process on schedule, court officials say.

In biology, the technique is used to determine the evolutionary relationships between different species. In its application in textual criticism, the text of a number of different manuscripts is entered into a computer, which records all the differences between them. The manuscripts are then grouped according to their shared characteristics. The difference between cladistics and more traditional forms of statistical analysis is that, rather than simply arranging the manuscripts into rough groupings according to their overall similarity, cladistics assumes that they are part of a branching family tree and uses that assumption to derive relationships between them. This makes it more like an automated approach to stemmatics. However, where there is a difference, the computer does not attempt to decide which reading is closer to the original text, and so does not indicate which branch of the tree is the root—which manuscript tradition is closest to the original. Other types of evidence must be used for that purpose.

The use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings, for instance those of Delacroix. Perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (1818–1819), where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle.

Several news outlets have attempted to contact the family or the authorities for comment, but as of yet, no official statements have been made. The O'Neill brothers were arrested in Venezuela in 2016 for attempting to smuggle 1.3 tonnes of cocaine. They were sentenced to nearly a decade in prison, but it appears that they have somehow managed to leave the notorious prison and return home to Ireland. The circumstances surrounding the O'Neill brothers' escape and alleged return to Ireland are still uncertain. More information will likely come to light in the upcoming days and weeks as authorities investigate how the men were able to leave prison and if their reported sightings in Ireland are accurate. Until then, their story remains a fascinating mystery."},{"prompt":"Question: What type of media was included with purchase of the U2 version of the iPod?

This adaptation of the beloved Andrew Lloyd Webber musical is an absolute disaster from start to finish. The CGI is unsettling and makes the actors look like they're trapped in some sort of furry hell dimension.

One of the players who has consistently thrown first quarter touchdowns is Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs. Mahomes is known for his strong arm and ability to read the defense quickly, allowing him to make quick and accurate throws in the early stages of the game. Other notable quarterbacks who have thrown first quarter touchdowns include Tom Brady of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers. However, quarterbacks are not the only players who have thrown first quarter touchdowns. Some of the league's top running backs have also been able to make plays in the early stages of the game. For example, Alvin Kamara of the New Orleans Saints has thrown a few first quarter touchdowns in recent seasons, showcasing his versatility as a player. In addition to quarterbacks and running backs, some wide receivers have also been able to throw first quarter touchdowns. This includes players like Jarvis Landry of the Cleveland Browns and Julian Edelman of the New England Patriots, who both have strong arms and the ability to make accurate throws. Overall, there are numerous players in the NFL who have been able to throw first quarter touchdowns throughout the season.

An ignition coil (also called a spark coil) is an induction coil in an automobile's ignition system that transforms the battery's low voltage to the thousands of volts needed to create an electric spark in the spark plugs to ignite the fuel. Some coils have an internal resistor, while others rely on a resistor wire or an external resistor to limit the current flowing into the coil from the car's 12volt supply.

Originally, every ignition coil system required mechanical contact breaker points and a capacitor (condenser).

In the context of the British Empire, many former colonies initially became \\"Dominions,\\" a special status that recognized their ties to Great Britain while granting them significant autonomy. But when did these ties come to an end? The answer to this question depends on which specific former colony we are talking about. For example, India became independent in 1947 but did not become a republic until 1950. Similarly, Pakistan was granted independence in 1947 but remained a Dominion until 1956. If we focus on the largest Dominions – Canada, Australia, and New Zealand – the answer is that the Dominion status came to an end at different times. Canada was the first to shed its Dominion title, doing so in 1931 with the passage of the Statute of Westminster. This legislation recognized Canada as fully independent and removed the British Parliament's ability to pass laws that applied to Canada without its consent. Australia and New Zealand followed suit shortly thereafter, with the Statute of Westminster being adopted by both countries in 1947. However, while the passage of the Statute was a significant step toward full independence, it was not until the Australia Act 1986 and the Constitution Act 1986 in New Zealand that these countries finally severed all legal ties to the British Parliament. In summary, the number of years that passed between the grant of independence and the end of Dominion status varied depending on the specific former colony. However, for Canada, it was 60 years, while for Australia and New Zealand, it was closer to 40 years."},{"prompt":"Solve 243 + 946 = 134*n + 3735 for n..

Dry the CD. Try stronger abrasives.","completion":"When it comes to keeping CDs in good condition, scratches can be a real problem. A scratched CD not only looks bad, it can cause skips and distortion while playing the disc. Luckily, there are simple solutions to fix scratched CDs. One popular method is using toothpaste to repair the scratching. To try this method, squirt the toothpaste onto a lint-free cloth and gently wipe the scratched area. Be sure to use a non-gel and non-whitening toothpaste for best results. The active ingredient in toothpaste, baking soda, serves as a mild abrasive that can buff out surface-level scratches. After wiping the surface with toothpaste, wash off the toothpaste under cold water. Dry the CD with a clean, lint-free cloth before trying to play it. If the scratches are relatively minor, this method can effectively improve the playability of a CD. However, if the toothpaste method does not work, you can try stronger abrasives. There are commercial CD repair solutions available in the market. You can also try using brass polish or automobile wax to restore the scratched surface. Use these stronger abrasives with caution as they can potentially cause more damage to the CD. In conclusion, while scratches on CDs can be a nuisance, there are ways to fix them. Using toothpaste as a mild abrasive and trying stronger abrasives as a last resort can effectively improve the condition of a damaged CD.

Fans eagerly await this moment, and players strive to be the first ones to score. Determining which team scored first in a game can have a great impact on how the rest of the game is played. There are many factors that can influence which team will score first. The skill level of the players, the quality of the opposing team's defense, and even luck can all play a role in determining who will make the first score. In some cases, it may be a well-planned play that leads to the first goal, while in other situations it may be a lucky shot that catches the goal-keeper by surprise. To determine which team scored first, it is important to closely follow the game and keep track of the score. Typically, the scoreboard will indicate which team has scored and at what time this occurred. In some cases, the announcer or commentator may also provide this information for viewers who are watching the game on television or listening to it on the radio. In addition to keeping track of the score, it is also important to pay close attention to the players and their movements on the field. By watching the action closely, you may be able to anticipate which team is more likely to score first based on their performance in the game up to that point. Determining which team scored first can be an important factor in understanding how a game is progressing. If one team is able to score first, it can provide a boost of energy and momentum that can carry them through the rest of the game. On the other hand, if a team falls behind early, they may be forced to play more aggressively to catch up, which can leave them vulnerable to counter-attacks. Ultimately, the team that scores first in a game can have a significant impact on the outcome, but it is important to remember that anything can happen in sports. Even if a team scores first, there is always the potential for the opposing team to mount a comeback and take control of the game. In the end, it is the team that puts forth the strongest effort and executes the best plays that will ultimately come out on top."},{"prompt":"ere is some data: SEASON 201112; 201112 AGGREGATE 90; 201112 COMPETITION UEFA Europa League; AEK Larnaca F.C.; 201112 CLUB Floriana.

Allow your child to reap what he or she sows. Use timeouts as a consequence.

One effective approach is to set clear boundaries for children's behavior. Establishing clear expectations and consequences for their actions will help children understand what is expected of them and the potential outcomes of their behavior. It's also important to remain calm when enforcing boundaries. Anger and frustration can cloud judgment and result in ineffective parenting. Staying level-headed will allow parents to think clearly and devise appropriate strategies for addressing misbehavior. When children break the established boundaries, it's essential to allow them to reap what they sow. Holding them accountable for their actions helps them understand the consequences of their behavior and prepares them for the real world. Time-outs can serve as an effective consequence for undesirable behavior. Giving children time to reflect on their actions in a quiet and controlled environment can help them understand where they went wrong and what steps they can take to prevent similar mistakes in the future. Finally, privileges can be withdrawn as a consequence for behavior that is unacceptable. Removing privileges such as TV, phone or gaming time is a powerful motivator to help children understand the seriousness of their actions. In conclusion, setting clear boundaries and consequences, remaining calm and consistent in enforcing those boundaries, and allowing children to face the consequences of their actions are key elements of effective parenting. While it may not always be easy, this approach can lay the foundation for children to grow into responsible and respectful individuals."},{"prompt":"Data: United States ETHNIC_GROUP Asian Americans; Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians COUNTRY United States What would a sentence about this data be like?","completion":"Asian Americans are an ethnic group in the United States, and \\"Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians\\" is set in the United States."},{"prompt":"w would one describe the sentiment of this tweet?

When considering how far a ball has traveled, we often compare the actual distance with some sort of benchmark. In this case, we are comparing the actual distance with a starting point of 61 yards. To determine how many yards more than 61 the ball sailed through the air, we need to know the actual distance traveled. If we know this information, we can simply subtract 61 from the actual distance to find the answer. However, if we don't have the actual distance, we may need to rely on other information to estimate the answer. For example, if we know that the ball sailed 10 yards beyond the goalpost, and we know that the goalpost is located at the end of a 100-yard field, we can estimate that the ball traveled approximately 110 yards. Subtracting 61 from 110 gives us an answer of 49 yards. In another scenario, if we know that the ball was kicked from the 30-yard line and it landed on the 5-yard line at the other end of the field, we can estimate that the ball traveled approximately 75 yards. Subtracting 61 from 75 gives us an answer of 14 yards. In short, to determine how many yards more than 61 the ball sailed through the air, we simply subtract 61 from the actual distance traveled. If we don't have the actual distance, we may need to rely on other information to estimate the answer."},{"prompt":"Read this: Years later, Kaunitz kept trying to establish France's alliance with Austria.

Kira Izzard and Laura Cull have been in a committed relationship for four years and wanted to attend the church together. However, the church leader claimed that as they were not a traditional family unit, they were not welcome. The decision was roundly criticised by many, including The Island's Chief Minister, Allan Bell, who condemned the decision as \\"bigoted\\". He argued that love and commitment should be celebrated, regardless of gender or sexuality. \\"It is disappointing to see such attitudes still present in our society,\\" he added. Many others have also spoken out in support of Izzard and Cull, pointing out that the church should be a welcoming and inclusive space for all members of the community. They argue that a person's worth is not defined by their relationship status or sexual orientation, and that true Christian values promote love and acceptance for all. Despite the backlash, the church leader has refused to backtrack on his decision, stating that he is simply upholding the principles of his faith. However, many others have argued that his actions are in direct contradiction to the teachings of Christianity, which promote compassion, forgiveness, and understanding. Ultimately, the case highlights the ongoing debate around the role of religion in modern society, and to what extent traditional values should be upheld. While many argue that religion should continue to play an important role in shaping moral values, others argue that it can also be a means of exclusion and discrimination. At the heart of the matter, however, is the simple truth that all individuals should be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their beliefs or personal circumstances."},{"prompt":"Ayala sent back the diamond necklace.

He stated that there has been a growing trend in televised trials abroad and that this has increased public awareness of legal proceedings in those countries. In noting that the public knows more about foreign legal systems than their own, he argues that cameras in courtrooms could be beneficial in the UK. Sir Keir commented on the strange dichotomy where there is more public knowledge of legal proceedings abroad but little visibility into domestic courts. The use of cameras could assist in demystifying the legal system, providing greater transparency, and instilling confidence in the judicial system. It is not the first time that the issue of televised court proceedings has been raised. In 2013, the Ministry of Justice held a consultation on the issue, which led to a limited pilot program. However, the program was scrapped amid concerns that it could lead to witness intimidation, breaches of privacy, and a negative effect on court proceedings. These concerns are valid, but they ought not to overrule the benefits of transparency, which can foster greater trust in the judicial system. Cameras could also provide an educational resource, whereby the public can learn about how trials are conducted, the roles of judges and lawyers in the process, and the significance of the evidence presented. In conclusion, while there are legitimate concerns surrounding the broadcast of court proceedings, the trend in other countries and Sir Keir Starmer's comments underscore the growing importance of transparency and openness in the legal system. The potential benefits of cameras in UK courtrooms must be balanced with any associated risks.

However, Allardyce has remained adamant that Carroll was the right choice for West Ham, noting his physical presence and ability to cause problems for opposing defenders. As it stands, West Ham will face off against Swansea at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday. This will be a chance for both teams to test their mettle early on in the season, and for West Ham to prove that they made the right decision in signing Carroll. All in all, the debate over Carroll versus Bony is likely to continue for some time, and it remains to be seen what impact the two players will have on their respective clubs this season. For now, though, Allardyce and West Ham will be looking to start the campaign off on the right foot with a good result against Swansea."},{"prompt":"What kind of task would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning?","completion":"A task that involves manipulating objects or structures, such as assembly or disassembly of mechanical parts, may test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning."},{"prompt":"3 years ago 06:15 SheShaft dogging, shaving, mature anal, deepthroat, mature Please remove spaces between words.","completion":"3yearsago06:15SheShaftdogging,shaving,matureanal,deepthroat,mature"},{"prompt":"Answer a question about this article: For 1890, the Census Office changed the design of the population questionnaire.

This pandemic virus arose shortly before the outbreak and left people unusually vulnerable. Researchers found that the strain developed when a human H1 virus that had been in circulation since 1900, picked up genetic material from a bird flu virus. This mutation was the reason for the virus's deadly impact as people had not been previously exposed to it. The virus spread rapidly across the world, affecting both developed and developing countries. It did not discriminate against age or social status and killed millions of people worldwide. The virus quickly overwhelmed healthcare systems and doctors struggled to come up with treatments that could work against it. As a result, many people died due to lack of proper care and medication. The 1918 flu pandemic remains one of the deadliest pandemics in history, and lessons were learned from this event. Today, we have advanced medical technologies and extensive research capabilities that help us understand and fight deadly viruses like COVID-19. It is essential that we continue to invest in scientific research and development of vaccines and treatments to prepare for future pandemics. History has taught us that viruses can mutate, and we must be prepared for any eventuality. In conclusion, the 1918 flu pandemic was a devastating event that affected millions of people worldwide.

Torres is currently sidelined with a knee injury.","completion":"Manchester City Interested in Signing Fernando Torres from Liverpool Manchester City has reportedly expressed an interest in signing Liverpool striker Fernando Torres. The news came from City Manager Roberto Mancini, who stated that many teams in Europe would like to have Torres on their team. However, Liverpool Manager Rafael Benitez insists that Torres is happy at Liverpool and has no intention of leaving the club. The player has been with Liverpool since 2007 and has been a key player for the club ever since, scoring 81 goals in 142 appearances. Torres is currently sidelined with a knee injury, which he picked up during a match against Sunderland in February. He underwent surgery and is expected to return to training in early April. Despite this setback, Torres is one of the most sought-after strikers in Europe, with many clubs eager to secure his signature. If Manchester City does decide to pursue Torres, they will have to pay a hefty transfer fee to Liverpool. However, the potential addition of Torres to the team could strengthen their attacking options and help them secure a higher spot in the Premier League. In conclusion, speculation continues to swirl around Fernando Torres' future, with Manchester City expressing an interest in signing him. Liverpool, however, insists that the player is happy at the club and remains focused on his recovery from injury. Only time will tell if Torres will stay with Liverpool or move on to a new club."},{"prompt":"Why doesn't she want me What is the sentiment of this tweet?

But new items have been added to the menu, including 1 Frozen Coke and 1 Choc Waffle cone. The 'Loose Change' menu is designed to sell items no more than 2.","completion":"Recently, McDonald's has made some changes to their menu that has certainly caught the attention of its customers. For starters, the Soft Serve Cone, a beloved menu item, has increased in price from 30 cents to 50 cents since last Tuesday. In addition, the Small Fries and Apple Pies have been removed from the ‘Loose Change’ menu, making them more expensive to purchase. According to a McDonald's spokesperson, the Soft Serve Cone was only 30 cents as a promotional item for a limited time. Although upsetting to some customers, this price increase is not unusual for the fast-food giant. However, to make up for these changes, McDonald's has added new items to the menu. One such item is the 1 Frozen Coke, which has quickly become a popular menu item. In addition, the 1 Choc Waffle Cone has also been added to the menu to provide customers with more variety. These new items may help to offset the disappointment of the price increase for some devotees. It's important to note that McDonald's offers the ‘Loose Change’ menu, which is designed to sell items no more than 2. Unfortunately, the removal of Small Fries and Apple Pies from this menu means that loyal customers will now have to pay more for these items. While some may be unhappy with the changes to the menu, it's essential to remember that McDonald's is constantly adjusting its menu to provide the best consumer experience. It will be intriguing to see what other additions McDonald's makes to their menu in the future."},{"prompt":"Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: Ifyouwanttoknowinadvancewhatturnsmeoff:Rude,unpolitepeople,beggers!","completion":"\\"If you want to know in advance what turns me off, rude, impolite people and beggars!\\""},{"prompt":"What is the answer to this question? the compromise of 1877 signaled an end to?","completion":"The compromise of 1877 signaled an end to Reconstruction."},{"prompt":"Generate a sentence about this data: Peñarol, league, Uruguayan Primera División; Abel Hernández, youthclub, Peñarol; U.S. Città di Palermo, manager, Giuseppe Iachini; Abel Hernández, club, Uruguay national football team; Abel Hernández, club, U.S. Città di Palermo","completion":"Abel Hernández played for Peñarol's youth club before moving on to play for U.S. Città di Palermo, where he was managed by Giuseppe Iachini, and was also part of both the Uruguayan Primera División and the Uruguay national football team."},{"prompt":"The man felt thankful to be alive.

The spiritual revolution that took place, saw a waning of the old Greek religion, whose decline beginning in the 3rd century BC continued with the introduction of new religious movements from the East. The cults of deities like Isis and Mithra were introduced into the Greek world. Greekspeaking communities of the Hellenized East were instrumental in the spread of early Christianity in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, and Christianity's early leaders and writers (notably St Paul) were generally Greekspeaking, though none were from Greece. However, Greece itself had a tendency to cling to paganism and was not one of the influential centers of early Christianity: in fact, some ancient Greek religious practices remained in vogue until the end of the 4th century, with some areas such as the southeastern Peloponnese remaining pagan until well into the 10th century AD.

Union members were protesting a decision not hire workers from one of the county's largest unions to drive cast and crew vehicles. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Bravo's popular cooking competition show, Top Chef, was marred by a series of abusive episodes involving picketers affiliated with the Teamsters union during filming in Boston in June. Host Padma Lakshmi and the production crew were subjected to verbal assaults and intimidation tactics by the picketers protesting the decision not to hire workers from one of the county's largest unions to drive cast and crew vehicles. The two-week period of filming was disrupted by protesters who slashed tires and hurled insults at the crew. The situation escalated when one of the picketers aggressively and violently threatened Padma Lakshmi upon her arrival for filming. A crew-member reported that the host was scared and shaken by the man's irrational behavior. The picketers were affiliated with the Teamsters union, which had lodged a complaint against the production company for hiring drivers who were not union members. However, the use of intimidation tactics and verbal abuse against the cast and crew was a grossly inappropriate response that created an unsafe working environment for all involved. The production company and Bravo released a statement condemning the behavior of the picketers and asserting their commitment to providing a safe and supportive work environment for the cast and crew. The Teamsters union also issued a statement disavowing any involvement in the abusive behavior and stating that they would discipline any members found to be responsible. The incidents surrounding the filming of Top Chef in Boston serve as a reminder of the importance of respectful and civil dialogue in labor disputes. While unions have an important role in protecting workers' rights and advocating for fair labor practices, abusive or violent behavior is never an acceptable means of expressing dissent. Moving forward, it is crucial that all parties involved in labor disputes prioritize communication, transparency, and a commitment to resolving differences without resorting to intimidation or aggression."},{"prompt":"Does use mean the same thing in these two sentences?
