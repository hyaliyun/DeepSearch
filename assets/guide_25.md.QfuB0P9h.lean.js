If identity is a kind of virtual site in which the dynamic processes and markers used for identification are made apparent, boundaries provide the framework on which this virtual site is built.

If I sound cynical it's because I am fed up with movies hawking a political agenda. The military brass in this movie are portrayed as, what else? Gungho war mongers. Sound familiar? Ever see a movie where the CIA or any government agency is not evil? Think about it. Yet again, Crimson Tide stresses the point. The Hackman character, Uboat captain Ramsey, comes across like a raving lunatic, until the very end when, of course he comes to his senses, does a complete 360, renounces his blood lust, suggests a promotion for the treasonous Ron Hunter, and repents by retiring from the service. A guy mutinies, takes command of your boat, puts the U.S at grave risk of receiving a nuclear firststrike, and you promote him???? What hogwash!

But it also proves troublesome for immigration advocates since the U.S. is dealing with an influx of illegal migrants. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"President Barack Obama, who had pledged in June to act on immigration reform before the end of the summer, has decided to postpone any action until after the midterm elections in November. The move comes as a relief to Democrats running in highly-contested races, but is a blow to immigration advocates who argue that the U.S. is currently dealing with an influx of illegal migrants. Obama had originally indicated that he would take executive action to reform the country’s immigration system in the face of Congressional inaction. However, recent polling has indicated that some Democrats, particularly those running for re-election in conservative states, were concerned about the issue and were urging Obama to delay any action. The immigration question has become a high-profile issue in many states, spurring voter interest and shaping the electoral landscape. Many Democrats are running in districts with large Hispanic populations and have been pushing for immigration reform, while Republicans have taken a harder line on the issue, criticizing Obama for failing to enforce existing laws and securing the border. For immigration advocates, Obama’s decision to postpone action is seen as a missed opportunity to address a problem that they argue is a crisis. The U.S. has been facing a surge of unaccompanied minors crossing the border, and advocates have been calling on Congress and the White House to take action to address the situation. While Obama has not yet spelled out what he intends to do after the midterm elections, speculation has been rampant that he will implement some form of executive order to address immigration reform. However, that approach could create more political problems for Democrats and lead to increased opposition from Republicans. The immigration question has become one of the most contentious issues in the U.S. political arena, with activists on both sides of the issue pressuring politicians to act. The decision by Obama to delay action is sure to reignite the debate and possibly increase the stakes for Democrats in the midterm elections."},{"prompt":"Generate a tweet that has the following sentiment: positive","completion":"\\"Just had the best day ever!

The move comes at a time when social media, particularly micro-blogging sites like Twitter, have played a significant role in co-ordinating protests and uprisings in the Arab world. Despite concerns that Alwaleed may attempt to influence or control user-generated content on the site, analysts predict that this will not be the case. In fact, many believe that Alwaleed's investment is simply a shrewd business move, aimed at diversifying his portfolio and tapping into the growing popularity of social media. It is clear, however, that the power of Twitter and other social media sites to mobilize and connect people is not lost on Alwaleed. As a businessman with extensive holdings and interests in the Middle East, he will no doubt be closely observing the ways in which Twitter and other social media platforms continue to shape the political and social landscape of the region. Ultimately, the acquisition of a strategic stake in a micro-blogging site by a powerful and influential individual like Alwaleed raises important questions about the role of social media in shaping our world.

The touchdown came in the second quarter of the game, with the Chargers already leading 7-0. Tomlinson took a handoff from his quarterback, Philip Rivers, and found a gap in the Chiefs' defense. He then accelerated downfield, leaving Kansas City's defenders in his wake. By the time he crossed the goal line, he had covered 91 yards in total, making it the longest scoring run of his illustrious career. Tomlinson was widely regarded as one of the best running backs of his era. He spent the majority of his career with the San Diego Chargers (now the Los Angeles Chargers), but also played for the New York Jets. He retired from the NFL in 2012, having amassed over 13,600 rushing yards and 145 rushing touchdowns.

Fortunately, most courses provide a scorecard that outlines important details about the holes and their respective difficulty levels. One of the first things to look for on a scorecard is the \\"hole\\" column, which will typically list the holes from 1 to 18. This will help you keep track of where you are on the course and what's coming up next. Next, it's important to identify the front and back 9 sections of the course. Typically, the front 9 will be the first 9 holes played, while the back 9 will be the final 9 holes. This split course into 2 halves, and knowing which holes make up each half can help you develop a game plan. The scorecard will also typically list the color names on the side, which indicate each hole's distance. This can help you determine what clubs to use and how to approach each hole. A crucial piece of information listed on the scorecard is the handicap section. This section ranks the holes by difficulty, with the most challenging hole receiving the highest handicap number. This information can help you prioritize which holes to focus on during your practice sessions and develop a strategic game plan. Finally, be sure to spot the par information, which states how many shots you should take to complete each hole. This information will help you keep track of your score throughout the round and adjust your strategy as needed. In conclusion, while it's easy to overlook the importance of a scorecard, it can actually be one of the most valuable tools in your golf bag.

Drinking plenty of water is another key component of a healthy diet. Water is essential for your body's functioning, including the transportation of nutrients and removal of waste. Try to aim for at least 8 glasses of water a day to stay hydrated and promote good health. Taking a whole foods multivitamin can also be beneficial in ensuring that you are getting all the necessary vitamins and minerals that may be missing from your diet.

Therefore, it is difficult to provide an exact number without specifying the particular season or game in question. However, statistical analysis of previous NFL seasons reveals that the number of field goals over 40 yards kicked has been steadily increasing over the years. For instance, in the 2019 NFL season, there were 206 field goals kicked from over 40 yards out, with a success rate of 70.9%. Furthermore, the use of advanced technology such as specialized kicking shoes, improved field conditions, and better training techniques for kickers has significantly contributed to the increased accuracy and distance of field goals. In addition, rule changes such as moving the kickoff line to the 35-yard line in 2011 have resulted in shorter kickoffs and more opportunities for field goals, including those over 40 yards. In conclusion, while it is not possible to provide an exact number of field goals over 40 yards kicked without specifying a particular game or season, statistical data indicates that the number of successful field goals from that range has been increasing over the years due to various factors."},{"prompt":"v movie awards!

Materials: - Pearl Ex pigment powder - Clear embossing powder - Heat gun - Stamp - Versamark ink pad - Cardstock paper - Paintbrush Instructions: 1. Choose a stamp that you would like to emboss onto your paper. Make sure the stamp is clean and free of any debris. 2. Ink the stamp with Versamark ink and stamp it onto the cardstock paper. 3. Mix a small amount of Pearl Ex pigment powder with clear embossing powder. A good rule of thumb is to use a ratio of 2 parts embossing powder to 1 part Pearl Ex. Mix the two powders together using a paintbrush. 4. Sprinkle the tinted powder mixture over the stamped image. Be sure to cover the entire stamped area. 5. Tap off any excess powder and return it to the container. 6. Use a heat gun to melt the embossing powder. Hold the heat gun about 6 inches away from the paper and move it around in circular motions. The powder mixture will start to melt and become shiny. 7. Continue to heat the powder mixture until it is completely melted and smooth. 8. Let the embossed image cool for a few seconds and then use a soft cloth or tissue to wipe away any excess Pearl Ex pigment powder. Tips: - Experiment with different ratios of embossing powder to Pearl Ex for varying levels of shimmer and shine. - Use a small paintbrush to apply the powder mixture to small, intricate stamps. - Make sure your heat gun is pointed away from your face and any flammable objects. - Practice on a scrap piece of paper before embossing your final project.

With the rise of social media and the internet, we are more connected than ever before, but it’s easy to forget that there are real people behind the screens. Before you click that “send” or “post” button, take a moment to consider the impact of your words. In today’s digital age, it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that what we say online can have a profound effect on the people we communicate with. Being polite online isn’t just about being nice, it’s about being respectful of others. Remember that there are real people behind the usernames and profile pictures, and they have feelings, too. The words we use have the power to hurt, but they also have the power to uplift and inspire. It’s important to recognize that online interactions can have real-world consequences. Something that may seem harmless or innocuous to us could be deeply hurtful to someone else. Always be mindful of how your words can affect others, and strive to treat others how you would want to be treated. In addition to being polite, it’s important to think before you click. With the speed at which we can communicate online, it can be easy to get caught up in the heat of the moment and say something we later regret. Before you hit the “send” or “post” button, take a step back and consider whether what you’re about to say is necessary or helpful. Taking the time to think before you click can prevent misunderstandings and hurt feelings. If you’re unsure about how your words may be received, try putting yourself in the other person’s shoes. Ask yourself how you would feel if someone said the same thing to you. In conclusion, always think before you click, and always be polite. Our words have the power to connect us or to drive us apart, and it’s up to us to choose how we use that power. By being mindful of our online interactions and treating others with respect and kindness, we can help create a more positive and connected online community."},{"prompt":"Select the topic that this about: The company impresses the Street with strong earnings, an optimistic outlook, and a toehold abroad.

However, the traditional family household with a married couple and one or more children under the age of 18 is still the most common household in the US. Based on the latest statistics from the US Census Bureau, married-couple families with children under 18 accounted for 20.9% of all households in 2019. This percentage has slightly declined from previous years due to the rise of non-traditional families such as unmarried couples with children, single-parent households, and living alone individuals. The percentage of households with married couples and no children under 18 is also significant, accounting for 28.9% of all households in 2019. This suggests that while families with children are still prevalent, there is a growing trend of couples without children. Non-family households, where individuals live alone or with non-relatives, account for 28.4% of all households in the US. This reflects the increasing number of people who choose to live alone, either for personal or economic reasons. In terms of income, statistics show that households with a higher income are more likely to be married-couple families. Meanwhile, low-income households are more likely to be either single individuals, single-parent households or cohabiting couples. In conclusion, while there are several types of households in the US, the traditional family household with a married couple and children under 18 remains the most common. However, non-traditional family structures are on the rise, and non-family households are becoming more common as well."},{"prompt":"Answer the question about text: Instead she said she was going to the rodeo ( gag me ) with my sister Amy and her boyfriend Drew .

While a traditional ice scraper or brush may seem like the go-to option for removing snow, it's important to remember that these tools can cause damage to delicate surfaces. One tip to keep in mind when removing snow is to use only a foam brush. Foam brushes are a gentle and effective way to remove snow from surfaces like cars, windows, and outdoor furniture without causing any damage.

Another benefit of using a foam brush is that it can be used on a variety of surfaces, from glass to metal to plastic. This makes it a versatile tool to have on hand during the winter months. In addition to using a foam brush, it's always a good idea to clear snow as soon as possible after it falls. This can prevent it from freezing and becoming more difficult to remove.

For example, if you notice that some of your food isn't cooking evenly, you may need to switch the basket and grill pan around. This will result in more even heating, and your food will be cooked more uniformly. Finally, make sure to clean your air fryer and accessories after each use. After you have finished cooking and the air fryer has cooled down, use a soft damp cloth to wipe down the interior and exterior of the air fryer.

However, many are surprised to learn that she rarely plucks or applies makeup to them. So, how does she maintain those lovely arches? The answer lies in the HD brow treatment. The HD brow treatment is a four-step process that includes browmapping, tinting, waxing, and threading. During the process, custom-blended colors are used to ensure that the client receives the ideal shade for their brows. Kate Battersby had her eyebrows tinted as part of this treatment. The dye ensured that her brows looked naturally fuller, darker, and more defined. In addition to the tint, HD brow providers also focus on shaping the brows. With the browmapping technique, they measure the client's face and adjust the arches accordingly. They also wax and thread the excess hair that falls outside the mapped lines. The results of the HD brows treatment are stunning, and Kate Battersby is proof. However, the process offers more than just a one-time transformation. HD brow providers like Nilam, who is known for her celebrity clientele, also offer a regrowth plan. Eighty percent of her clients follow the regrowth plan for up to 18 months.

Dishwasher salt, which is coarsegrained sodium chloride (table salt), is used to regenerate the resin in the builtin ionexchange system. The coarse grains prevent it from clogging the softener unit. Unlike certain types of salt used for culinary purposes, it does not contain added anticaking agents or magnesium salts. The presence of magnesium salts will defeat the purpose of removing magnesium from the water softener. Anticaking agents may lead to clogging or may contain magnesium. Table salt may contain added iodine in the form of sodium iodide or potassium iodide.

The participants were asked if music helped them cope with the pain of labor, and most said that it did. Furthermore, the participants also recommended music to other soon-to-be mothers. The poll also revealed that some of the most popular songs played during labor were by artists such as Katy Perry, Diana Ross, and Robbie Williams. It's interesting to note that despite the craze for music during labor, few mothers remembered the song they gave birth to. The use of music during labor is not a new phenomenon. Music has long been known to have therapeutic benefits, and its role in pain management has been studied extensively. It's believed that listening to music can help reduce anxiety, lower blood pressure, and decrease pain perception. In recent years, hospitals have begun incorporating music into their labor and delivery rooms, playing soft, soothing music to help calm the expectant mother during the process. Some hospitals even provide playlists for mothers to choose from or encourage them to bring their own music. Overall, the poll results suggest that music can be a valuable tool for expectant mothers during labor. It's not only helpful in reducing pain, but it can also provide a sense of comfort and relaxation during a stressful time.

Get tested before symptoms occur. Have one of two types of tests. Get treated immediately.","completion":"Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can have serious health consequences if left untreated. One of the most concerning aspects of chlamydia is that it often does not present with any symptoms, meaning many people may not realise they have it. The best way to protect yourself is to know your risks for chlamydia, and to get tested regularly. There are two types of tests available for chlamydia: urine tests and swab tests. The urine test is a quick and painless procedure that simply involves providing a sample of urine, whereas the swab test can be slightly more uncomfortable as it involves taking a swab from the inside of the genitals. However, both tests are highly effective at identifying whether or not you have chlamydia. If you do receive a positive diagnosis for chlamydia, it is extremely important that you seek treatment immediately. While chlamydia is easily treatable with a course of antibiotics, leaving it untreated can lead to serious complications such as infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease, and chronic pain. Additionally, if you have chlamydia, you may also be at increased risk for other STIs. In conclusion, the best way to protect yourself from the serious health consequences of chlamydia is to get tested regularly. You may not have any symptoms, so it is important to be proactive about getting tested. If you do test positive, seek treatment as soon as possible to minimise the risk of complications. With early detection and treatment, chlamydia can be easily managed and does not have to impact your long-term health."},{"prompt":"Article: Director Sima Urale is an awardwinning filmmaker.

This could include checking the weather conditions, researching the area you'll be exploring, or familiarizing yourself with any necessary safety precautions. 2. Dress Appropriately: Depending on the weather conditions and the activity you'll be doing, you'll want to dress appropriately. Bring comfortable clothes and shoes that you don't mind getting wet, and consider a waterproof jacket or rain gear if there's any chance of rain. Dress in layers in case the weather changes during your trip. 3. Bring Sunscreen: Whether you're swimming, boating, or simply lounging on the deck, it's important to protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays. Bring a sunscreen with at least SPF 30 and apply it liberally throughout the day. Don't forget to reapply after swimming or sweating. 4. Prepare for Sea Sickness: If you're prone to motion sickness, be sure to bring medication or other remedies to help you combat any potential symptoms. Ginger, for example, is known for its anti-nausea properties and can be taken in various forms such as capsules, tea or candies.

These drugs are available without a prescription and are easy to purchase at your local pharmacy. NSAIDs are also commonly used to relieve menstrual cramps. NSAIDs work by blocking the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals that cause pain, inflammation, and fever. By inhibiting the production of these chemicals, NSAIDs provide relief from pain and other symptoms. The most commonly used NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. These drugs are effective for relieving mild to moderate pain and are also used to reduce fever. When taking NSAIDs, it is important to carefully read and follow the package instructions. Avoid taking more than the recommended dose or using NSAIDs for an extended period of time unless directed to do so by your healthcare provider. Fish Oil Supplements for Omega-3 Intake Fish oil supplements are a popular way to increase your intake of omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential nutrients that our bodies need but cannot produce on their own. Omega-3 fatty acids are important for brain health, heart health, and reducing inflammation throughout the body. While it is ideal to get omega-3s from dietary sources, such as oily fish, it can be difficult to consume enough of these foods to meet your daily needs. Fish oil supplements are a convenient and affordable way to increase your omega-3 intake. When choosing a fish oil supplement, it is important to look for a product that is high in EPA and DHA, which are the two main omega-3 fatty acids found in fish. It is also important to select a supplement that has been independently tested for purity and potency. In conclusion, taking over-the-counter NSAIDs is an effective way to relieve pain and cramping, while fish oil supplements are a convenient way to increase your omega-3 intake. However, it is important to use these products safely and as directed. If you have any questions or concerns, be sure to consult with your healthcare provider."},{"prompt":"Math Problem Solve 7021 + 50017 4542 = 3088*y for y.","completion":"y=15"},{"prompt":"Write a question about the following article: After their bye week, the Lions traveled east to play the Philadelphia Eagles.

For instance, Virgin Galactic's space tourism program, which aims to make space tourism accessible to the general public, costs 250,000 per person for a 90-minute flight. To reduce the initial cost of space tourism, several initiatives are being implemented. For example, Elon Musk's SpaceX aims to reduce the cost of space travel by developing reusable rockets that can be launched and landed multiple times. Additionally, NASA is partnering with private companies to develop commercial spaceships that can transport astronauts to and from the International Space Station.

The Pope's message is a reminder that we need to learn how to communicate with each other, not just through digital means, but through face-to-face conversations as well. The rise of social media has made it easy for us to connect with people from all around the globe, but it has also made it easier to become isolated from those around us. The Pope's message reminds us that we need to be present in the lives of those around us, to listen to their stories, and to engage with them on a personal level. In conclusion, Pope Francis' message reminds us of the importance of human connection and the need for face-to-face communication. It's time to put down our iPhones and engage in meaningful conversations with those around us. By doing so, we can enrich our lives and build stronger relationships with those we care about the most."},{"prompt":"3monthsago08:00XXXDansauna,shower,Japanese,facial What's a sentence that uses these characters?","completion":"I'm sorry, but without additional information or context, I cannot create a coherent sentence using these characters."},{"prompt":"Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: During the afternoon he received a visit from Crister Stark who had come to check his progre","completion":"During the afternoon, he received a visit from Crister Stark, who had come to check his progress."},{"prompt":"Premise: As Kali, she is horrible to look at, with a long tongue and staring eyes, and is kept satisfied by the blood of sacrificed animals.

The poverty line is a threshold that represents the minimum level of income or resources necessary to maintain an adequate standard of living. This threshold varies by country and is often adjusted for factors such as family size and geographic location. Once the poverty line has been established, we need to gather data on the population's income or resources. This information can be obtained through surveys, government records and other sources. Using this data, we can calculate the number of people who fall below the poverty line and subtract this number from the total population to determine the number of people who are not below the poverty line. It's important to note that poverty is a complex issue that goes beyond income and resources. Other factors such as access to education, healthcare, and social support also play a critical role in determining a person's overall well-being. In conclusion, determining the number of people who are not below the poverty line requires a thorough understanding of the poverty line and access to accurate data on the population's income and resources. However, it's important to remember that poverty is a multifaceted issue that requires a range of solutions beyond just income and resources."},{"prompt":"What is the most logical next event?

However, they were ultimately thwarted by a solid City defence, led by captain Vincent Kompany. The match was also notable for the lengthy delays caused by injuries to both teams. Both Swansea's Neil Taylor and City's Micah Richards were forced off with what looked like serious injuries, leading to almost 13 extra minutes being added on at the end of the game. Despite the frustrating delays, City were relieved to come away with the win and will be hoping to build on this performance in the remaining matches of the season. Meanwhile, Arsenal also had cause to celebrate, bouncing back from their midweek European defeat to move up to fourth place in the Premier League with a win. With several key players returning from injury, the Gunners looked much sharper and more organised than in recent weeks, and will be hoping to maintain their momentum in the coming games."},{"prompt":"Unsure about which type of W40 file you have Do you want to know exactly what it is who created it and how to open it Please fix the punctuation.","completion":"\\"Unsure about which type of W40 file you have?

It feels like an indie film made out of a play script. Morgan Freeman basically plays himself, although the director swears the script was not written for him. And there is the small irony of the actor that goes in a supermarket to do research for a film that he hasn't committed to yet. I mean, he actually made the film in the end and we are watching it :) I found the dialogue a bit too positive for my taste, but refreshing nonetheless. This is a film that inspires the viewer to take a look at their own lives and choose the direction in which to go. A bit too much emphasis on appearance, if you ask me.

Place your clothes Pack any electronics and items you need to access last. Test out the backpack by wearing it.","completion":"When preparing for a trip, one of the most important things you will need is a sturdy and reliable backpack. But with so many options available on the market, it can be difficult to choose the right one. One key consideration is to find a backpack that fits both your items and your mode of transportation. If you are walking or hiking, for example, you will want a backpack that distributes weight evenly and feels comfortable on your back. If you are traveling on public transportation, you may want to consider a smaller backpack that can be easily maneuvered. Once you have found the right backpack, the next step is to organize the items that are necessary for your trip. One way to make the most of the space in your backpack is to use the 1 to 6 rule for packing clothes. This rule suggests that you bring one outfit per day of your trip, plus one or two extra outfits, depending on the length of your journey. This will ensure that you have enough clothes without overpacking. To save even more space, you can roll your clothes instead of folding them. This method can help prevent wrinkles and also allows you to fit more items in your backpack. When packing, it is also a good idea to put your shoes in the bottom of your backpack first. This will help distribute the weight evenly and prevent your shoes from crushing the other items in your bag. Once your shoes are in place, you can start packing your clothes. Try to place heavier items at the bottom of your bag and lighter items on top. This will help keep your backpack balanced and prevent it from feeling too heavy on your back. If you are bringing electronics or other items that you will need to access frequently, be sure to pack them in an easily accessible part of your backpack. This might mean placing them in a separate compartment or on top of your other items. Before heading out on your trip, it is a good idea to test out your backpack by wearing it. This will help you get a feel for the weight distribution and make sure that everything is packed in a way that feels comfortable and secure. By following these tips, you can ensure that your backpack is packed efficiently and that you are ready for a great trip."},{"prompt":"Generate a descriptive sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = The Waterman, eatType = restaurant, food = Italian, familyFriendly = no, near = Crowne Plaza Hotel","completion":"The Waterman is an Italian restaurant near Crowne Plaza Hotel, but it is not family-friendly."},{"prompt":"*Cash Only* 5 for link removal!

When questioned later, Khan stated that he did not call 999, the UK emergency services number, because he was not \\"100 per cent sure\\" what was wrong with her.
