LGBTQ+ individuals may feel hurt, anxious or unsafe when they hear homophobic slurs. This can lead to depression, anxiety, and additional health concerns. Furthermore, derogatory language perpetuates discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. It reinforces harmful stereotypes and makes it more difficult for individuals to come out or express themselves openly. It can also make society less tolerant towards people who identify as LGBTQ+, and thereby contribute to further discrimination and marginalization. Finally, homophobic language contributes to a culture of hatred and intolerance. Language is a powerful tool, and when we use derogatory terms, we perpetuate the message that individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ are inferior or abnormal. We must work to create a world that is respectful and inclusive, where individuals are judged based on their character and not their sexual orientation.

Countries with vast oil reserves have often used their resources to leverage geopolitical power, while countries dependent on oil imports have sought to establish alliances and secure supplies. Oil production and distribution have influenced foreign policy and international diplomacy in many ways. Firstly, oil-producing countries use their resources as a bargaining tool in diplomacy. They can use their oil wealth to secure promises of support, investments or diplomatic recognition. This gives them considerable influence in shaping international affairs. Secondly, oil has been a trigger for conflicts between nations. Countries such as Iraq, Iran, and Kuwait have been involved in multiple wars over oil resources. The Gulf War, for instance, was triggered after Iraq invaded Kuwait to gain control of its oil reserves. The oil industry has also been a source of tension between oil-producing and oil-importing countries, as the former seek to raise prices and the latter seek to secure affordable supplies. Thirdly, oil has been a driving force in the formation of alliances and cooperative agreements between countries. Oil-dependent countries often seek to diversify their sources of oil imports and establish alliances with oil-producing countries as a means of securing steady supplies. Such alliances may lead to closer diplomatic ties and military cooperation between countries. Finally, the petroleum industry has played a crucial role in shaping global environmental policies. Oil production and distribution have contributed significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, which have led to climate change. This has created a growing awareness among nations of the need to transition to cleaner sources of energy and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Diplomatic efforts have resulted in the formation of global agreements such as the Paris Agreement, aimed at reducing carbon emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change.

In contrast, the Greeks believed in Hades or the Underworld, where the souls of the dead went after they were judged by the gods. Hades was not a place of punishment, but rather a neutral place where souls lived a shadowy existence without pain or pleasure. - The Norse mythology believed in several afterlife destinations, depending on one's behavior in life. The bravest warriors went to Valhalla, where they lived with the gods until they were needed for the final battle. Others went to Hel, a realm of the dead ruled by the goddess Hel, or to Niflheim, a cold and dark underworld ruled by Hel's father, Loki. - Hinduism believes in reincarnation, where the soul takes on different physical forms after death, depending on karma. The ultimate goal is to break the cycle of reincarnation and achieve moksha or liberation from the material world. - Christianity believes in a judgment day, where people will be judged for their deeds on Earth. Those who have faithfully followed Jesus Christ during their lives will go to heaven, while those who have rejected this will go to hell.

Eventually, in more massive stars, fusion reactions progress to form even heavier elements such as iron. However, when the star runs out of fuel, it can no longer generate enough heat and pressure to continue fusion reactions, and it will either collapse and explode as a supernova or evolve into a white dwarf. The elements created in stellar nucleosynthesis are then released into the universe through these explosive events, enriching the interstellar medium with heavier elements that can eventually form new stars and planets."},{"prompt":"What are some challenges faced by Catholic missions during the colonial era?","completion":"Colonial Catholic missions faced challenges such as resistance from indigenous peoples, cultural barriers, language barriers, political conflicts with colonizers, and competition from other religions."},{"prompt":"What are some important Tamil festivals and how are they celebrated?","completion":"Some important Tamil festivals are Pongal, Tamil New Year (Puthandu), Thaipusam, and Diwali.

One of the most intriguing ideas in transhumanism is the concept of uploading a person's consciousness, or mind, to a digital format. The basic idea is that the brain is essentially a complex computer, and that all of a person's thoughts, memories, and personality traits are the result of electrical and chemical processes in the brain. If we could map and replicate those processes in a digital format, we could effectively upload a person's mind into a computer or other digital device. This would allow that person to live on in a digital format, even after their physical body has died. Supporters of this idea believe that it could lead to immortality, as long as the digital format is maintained and updated. However, there are many technical and ethical challenges to overcome before we could actually achieve this goal. The human brain is incredibly complex, and we still have much to learn about how it works. Moreover, there are many questions about what it would mean to live on in a digital form, and whether such a format could truly replicate all of the nuances and complexities of human consciousness."},{"prompt":"w is the performance of drivers assessed in the Onemake series?","completion":"The performance of drivers in the One-make series is typically assessed based on their lap times and race results."},{"prompt":"Who is considered the first modern British sculptor?","completion":"The first modern British sculptor is considered to be Henry Moore."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"search-container"},B={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],H={key:0},j={key:1};function R(n,e,l,p,o,s){const u=g("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",q,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",B,[(i(!0),a(v,null,w(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(i(),k(u,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",E,' No results found for "'+h(o.searchQuery)+'".
