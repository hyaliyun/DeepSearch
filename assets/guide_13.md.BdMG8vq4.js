John Lewis and H&M also said warmer weather has had an impact on sales. Retail expert claims many shops failed to adapt to unusually warm climate. Lack of tshirts and dresses with coats and knitwear displayed too early.","completion":"The never-ending summer has reportedly damaged the profits of many retail giants, with John Lewis and H&M citing the warmer weather as having a negative impact on sales. According to a retail expert, many shops failed to adapt to the unusually warm climate. He claimed that customers were disappointed by the lack of t-shirts and dresses on display, with coats and knitwear being displayed too early. The unusually warm weather has thrown retailers into disarray, with many of them struggling to cope with the soaring temperatures. The traditional autumn/winter collections were not suited to the warmer weather, leaving many customers unable to find what they needed in the shops. This resulted in a loss of sales, which had a knock-on effect on profits. John Lewis, one of the UK's largest retail stores, said that sales of homeware and furniture had been strong during the summer months, but that clothing sales had been weak. Similarly, H&M reported a decline in sales in August, which they attributed to the weather. Retail expert, Mark Price, said that many retailers had not planned for the hot summer, and did not react quickly enough. He claimed that shops needed to be more responsive to changing weather patterns, and suggested that retailers should have more flexible buying strategies that allowed them to respond to the changing climate more quickly. Price also suggested that shops could have increased sales by adapting their marketing strategies to reflect the summer weather. For example, they could have run summer-themed promotions and events, or created a more visually appealing display of summer clothing. In conclusion, the never-ending summer has had a negative impact on retail sales, with many shops struggling to adapt to the unusually warm climate. The lack of t-shirts and dresses, combined with an over-reliance on autumn/winter collections, left many customers disappointed, resulting in a loss of sales and profits. Retailers must be more responsive to changing weather patterns in the future and should consider more flexible buying strategies and targeted marketing campaigns."},{"prompt":"Can you grow facial hair with Rogaine?

European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools (scholae monasticae), in which monks and nuns taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century. The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the Latin Church by papal bull as studia generalia and perhaps from cathedral schools. It is possible, however, that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception. Later they were also founded by Kings (University of Naples Federico II, Charles University in Prague, Jagiellonian University in Kraków) or municipal administrations (University of Cologne, University of Erfurt). In the early medieval period, most new universities were founded from preexisting schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education.

In the early part of the 20th century, San Diego hosted two World's Fairs: the PanamaCalifornia Exposition in 1915 and the California Pacific International Exposition in 1935. Both expositions were held in Balboa Park, and many of the Spanish/Baroquestyle buildings that were built for those expositions remain to this day as central features of the park. The buildings were intended to be temporary structures, but most remained in continuous use until they progressively fell into disrepair. Most were eventually rebuilt, using castings of the original façades to retain the architectural style. The menagerie of exotic animals featured at the 1915 exposition provided the basis for the San Diego Zoo.

A little bit of color can help to mask blemishes and imperfections on your skin. Of course, it's important to remember to wear sunscreen and to limit your exposure to harmful UV rays. Another option is to cover up with a sarong, swimsuit cover, or oversized shirt. These garments can help you feel more comfortable and give you a little more confidence when you're out in public. If you're feeling nervous about wearing a swimsuit, try practicing at home. Wear your suit around the house to get comfortable with it and get used to how it feels. This can help you feel more prepared when you're actually at the beach or the pool. It's also important to distract yourself so that you're not overly worried about the people around you. Listen to music or bring a book to read. Focus on having fun and enjoying yourself, rather than worrying about what other people might be thinking. Additionally, it can be helpful to surround yourself with people who make you feel good about yourself. Spend time with friends who are supportive and who lift you up, rather than tearing you down.

In Iraq, the US has been working with the Iraqi military in training their troops and providing air support. In Syria, the US has been supporting local militias who are fighting ISIS on the ground. In Afghanistan, the US has been providing military and financial aid to the Afghan government to help them combat ISIS and other extremist groups. Apart from these countries, the US has also been assisting other countries in their fight against ISIS. For instance, the US has provided intelligence and logistical support to Egypt to help them fight ISIS in the Sinai Peninsula. The US has also supported the Philippines' military efforts against ISIS-affiliated groups like Abu Sayyaf. It is worth noting that the US' involvement in the fight against ISIS has not been without controversy. Some critics have questioned the effectiveness of the US' military interventions, with some arguing that it has led to greater instability in the region. Others have raised concerns about the US' reliance on local militias, some of which have been accused of human rights abuses. Despite these criticisms, the US government has continued to prioritize the fight against ISIS, and their efforts have resulted in significant setbacks for the terrorist organization. As of 2021, ISIS has lost much of its territory and power in Iraq and Syria, although it continues to operate in smaller cells and carry out attacks in the region. With continued support from the US and its allies, the hope is that ISIS will eventually be defeated and peace restored to the affected regions."},{"prompt":"which currency is my card debited?

This year, smart watches, fitness trackers and even jewelry that flashes notifications are plentiful at CES. While the wearables market has been growing rapidly, the focus has mainly been on functionality rather than design. However, it seems that wearables are now starting to catch up with fashion. Companies such as Fitbit and Fossil have been expanding their range of wearables to include more stylish options, and new players are emerging with designs that are aimed at the fashion-conscious consumer. Some companies are even teaming up with high-end fashion designers to create products that blend both form and function. One such collaboration is with Tory Burch, who has designed a range of bands and bracelets for the Fitbit Flex 2. These bands are not only functional, but also stylish and come in a range of materials and colors. The move towards fashionable wearables is a smart one. While consumers might be initially drawn to the technical specifications, the design and appearance of the product is what ultimately converts the sale. Wearables that are heinous, bulky or look like technology more than fashion are likely to be ignored or forgotten quickly. As technology becomes more entrenched in our daily lives, it’s important for the fashion industry to embrace it and integrate it seamlessly into our everyday wardrobes. The success of collaborations like Tory Burch and Fitbit shows that there is a demand for wearables that are not only innovative but also stylish.

Parents should try to model healthy eating habits by incorporating a variety of nutritious foods into their own diets. This can help children develop a taste for healthy foods and make it easier for them to make healthy choices in the future. Another important rule is to avoid putting pressure on children to eat. Parents should create a relaxed atmosphere during meal times and allow children to choose how much they want to eat. Pressuring children to clean their plates or eat certain foods can create anxiety and negative associations with meal times. It is also important to be patient with children who are picky eaters. It can take multiple exposures to new foods before a child will try them, and forcing them to try new foods can backfire. Instead, parents should consistently offer a variety of healthy foods and allow their child to explore and develop their own preferences. Parents should never use punishment as a means to get their child to eat. Punitive measures, such as taking away dessert or TV privileges, can create resentment and negative associations with meal times.

Measure the mass of a given object. Measure the object's acceleration. Multiply the object's mass by its acceleration.","completion":"The relationship between force, mass, and acceleration is a fundamental concept in physics. Understanding this relationship is critical to comprehending how objects interact in the physical world. To begin, it's essential to know that force is defined as any influence that causes an object to undergo a change in motion. Meanwhile, acceleration refers to the rate at which an object changes its speed or direction. To measure the force exerted on a given object, one must first determine the object's mass. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter that an object contains. Once mass is determined, measuring the object's acceleration is necessary. Acceleration can be found by measuring the object's change in speed over a specific amount of time. After measuring both the mass of the object and its acceleration, it's possible to calculate the force being applied to the object. To do this, multiply the object's mass by its acceleration. The result of this equation is the force that the object is experiencing. This calculation is critical in understanding how forces influence objects and how objects interact with one another. In conclusion, understanding the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration is essential in comprehending how objects interact in the physical world. Measuring the mass of an object, its acceleration, and calculating the force exerted on the object is crucial in determining the impact of forces. By mastering these concepts, physicists can handle a variety of problems in the physical world."},{"prompt":"Write a sentence based on this summary: the national highway system is the wave of the future","completion":"The national highway system represents the future."},{"prompt":"My family and I have been to this location several times and it's always an adventure.

As Spain struggles to emerge from a difficult recession, Rajoy has emphasized the importance of implementing measures to stimulate growth and create jobs. One of the key steps the Rajoy government has taken to control public spending is to freeze public sector wages and hiring in the coming year's budget. This move has been met with mixed reactions, with some arguing that it will help to trim government expenses and others raising concerns about the impact it will have on a number of public services. Another noteworthy measure announced by Rajoy's government is the decision to increase pension payments by 1%. This comes as welcome news to pensioners who had seen their payments frozen in recent years due to the country's financial difficulties. Many analysts believe that Rajoy's focus on achieving economic recovery will be essential to Spain's long-term success. While there are still difficult times ahead for the country, there is hope that the new government's measures will help to stabilize the economy and move Spain towards a brighter future.

Wrap the fabric over the lower half of your face.","completion":"\\"Ways to Wear a Shemagh: The Triangle Fold Method\\" One of the most versatile pieces of clothing and accessories for outdoor enthusiasts and military personnel is the shemagh. This traditional Middle Eastern headdress is a rectangular scarf made of cotton or wool that can protect individuals from the sun, wind, and dust. It also serves as a towel, bandage, and signaling device. To make the most of your shemagh, you need to know how to wear it properly. One of the most popular methods is the triangle fold. Here's how you can do it: Step 1: Lay your shemagh flat on a clean surface, and fold it diagonally. Step 2: Hold the two ends of the longest side, and drape the shemagh over your head. The fold should be at the back of your neck. Step 3: Position the shemagh so that the two shorter ends are in front of you, and the longer end extends behind your shoulders. Step 4: Take the two shorter ends and knot them behind your head or tuck them into your shirt. Step 5: Adjust the shemagh to cover your head and neck or wrap it around your face and mouth, leaving a gap for your eyes. To achieve maximum coverage of your lower face and neck, you can also follow these steps: Step 6: Fold the shemagh in half again, creating a smaller triangle. Step 7: Hold the two corners of the folded edge and wrap them behind your neck, making sure the fabric covers your chin and mouth. Step 8: Bring the two corners up, crossing them over your nose and tying them at the back of your head. Step 9: Tuck any excess fabric behind your neck or collar. Depending on your needs and preferences, you can wear your shemagh loosely or tightly, with the knot or without it, over your head or around your neck. The triangle fold method is just one of many possibilities, but it's easy and effective, offering protection from the elements and a touch of style."},{"prompt":"'ve seen this film criticized with the statement, If you can get past the moralizing... That misses the point. Moralizing is in the conscience of the beholder, as it were. This is a decent film with a standard murder mystery, but with a distinct twist that surfaces midway through.

The agency is continuing to scrutinize over 3,500 other households for potentially improper payments. According to FEMA, some of those who received overpayments were deemed ineligible for aid and may have used the funds for non-qualifying expenses, such as vacations or rental properties. Others may have \\"double dipped\\" by receiving aid from multiple sources, or received funds for expenses that were later covered by insurance. FEMA's efforts to recover the overpaid funds underscore the agency's responsibility to ensure that disaster aid is distributed fairly and efficiently. While aid recipients rightly expect to receive the funds they are entitled to, it is equally important for FEMA to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not wasted or misused. That said, recovering overpaid disaster aid can be a difficult process. Some recipients may have already spent the funds, or may dispute FEMA's claim that they were overpaid. FEMA will need to carefully assess each case to determine the best course of action. In the meantime, FEMA will continue to work to ensure that aid is distributed in a timely and responsible manner. While it is always disappointing to see taxpayer funds go to waste, it is important to remember that FEMA's mission is to help communities in times of crisis. By working to recover overpaid funds, FEMA is fulfilling its obligation to the American people to use taxpayer dollars responsibly and effectively."},{"prompt":"Sentence: That the Dalai Lama claims Tibet independence disturbs the Chinese government.

There are many ways to achieve this, but four things which can help you to live a happier and healthier life are to eat healthy and exercise, spend time with high vibration people, make meditation a part of your routine, and keep a journal. Eating healthy and exercising are the keys to a fit body and a healthy mind. A balanced diet rich in nutrients and vitamins is essential for the proper functioning of our body. It is also important to exercise regularly to keep our body and mind in shape. Exercise increases our stamina, releases endorphins, and keeps us energized throughout the day. So, make sure you eat healthy and exercise on a regular basis to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The people we surround ourselves with play a significant role in our lives. It is said that we become the average of the five people we spend the most time with. Therefore, it is important to spend time with high vibration people, those who have a positive outlook on life, and who motivate and inspire us to achieve our goals. Meditation is a great way to calm our minds and reduce stress. Regular meditation can help to boost our mental health and make us feel more centered and grounded. It also helps improve our focus and concentration, which are key factors in achieving our goals. Lastly, keeping a journal can be an excellent way to stay connected to ourselves. Writing down our thoughts, emotions, and experiences can help us gain clarity, better understand our feelings, and track our progress towards our goals. It can also be a great source of inspiration when we look back and see how far we have come. In conclusion, these four things are just some of the ways we can live a happier, healthier life. Eating healthy and exercising, spending time with high vibration people, making meditation a part of our routine, and keeping a journal are all proven ways to achieve a more mindful and balanced life. So, make a conscious effort to include them in your daily routine, and experience the positive impact they can have on your life."},{"prompt":"Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 57 = 51*b + 86*b 1427 for b.","completion":"To solve the equation -57 = 51b + 86b - 1427 for b, we need to combine like terms and isolate the variable on one side of the equation.

This is the safest and most stress-free way to handle a snail. Approach the snail slowly and calmly, and gently place your hand in its path.

Keep your movements slow and smooth, as sudden movements can cause the snail to retract into its shell for protection. Step 3: Lower the snail to a new surface. When you are ready to put the snail down, choose a safe and appropriate location for it. Gently lower your hand until the snail crawls off by itself onto the new surface. Avoid dropping the snail from a height, as this can cause injury or harm. By following these simple steps, you can safely handle and interact with snails without causing them harm or stress.

However, there are some simple steps we can take to help us recharge and stay productive. Firstly, sometimes all we need is a change of scene. If you’re stuck in an office or at home all day, try stepping outside for a walk or sitting in a different room. This change can help refresh your mind and energize you for the tasks ahead. Next, consider adding some citrus to your diet. Eating an orange or grapefruit, or drinking a glass of fresh juice, can give you a boost of vitamin C, which can help fight fatigue and keep you alert. Another option for a pick-me-up is ginseng tea. This traditional Chinese medicine has long been used to boost energy and improve mental clarity. Just be sure to avoid caffeine and sugar later in the day, as these can disrupt your sleep and make you feel even more tired. In addition to these dietary changes, consider listening to upbeat music for a quick energy boost. Music has been shown to have a powerful effect on our moods, and listening to upbeat songs can help us feel more positive and motivated. Finally, if you’re really struggling to focus, try taking a power nap. Research has shown that a short nap of 20-30 minutes can help improve cognitive function and boost our energy levels.

However, even if you do not wear a suit, make sure to pick an outfit that is classy and professional, keeping in mind the occasion and the company's dress code. Secondly, keep your shirt simple, regardless of what you're wearing. Pairing it with a jacket that complements the outfit adds an extra touch of class. Thirdly, if you're unsure about the dress code or the appropriate footwear, go with hosiery, it will always make you look more professional.

(4.5 / 5) Stars. Much thanks to fellow Yelpers. This place is awesome. We ordered the Combo pan roast (A MUST), and the palace seafood jambalaya. The smell and watching them make the dishes are an appetizer themselves. We sat there drooling as the interesting heating bowls cooked our food. The Pan Roast was definitely the winner between the two dishes. It was chockful of shrimp, lobster, and crab pieces. The gravy was similar to a very velvety, almost buttery smooth concoction of tomato cream soup. The jambalaya was good as well but it doesn't hold up in a match against the Roast. Our only complaint is the single scoop of rice you get with it. They charge 2.50 for extra rice. We're asian, and we love our rice! Definitely hitting this place again when I head back to Vegas. Highly recommended for their Roast.

An improper fitting can lead to discomfort or injury to your equine friend, so it's best to entrust this task to a professional. Once you have the correctly fitted harness, it's time to start introducing it to your horse. Begin the training process by walking your horse on a lead line with the harness on. This will help your horse get used to the weight and feel of the harness. Next, practice lunging your horse with the harness. This is an excellent way to work on your horse's obedience and response to your commands while wearing the harness. After your horse is comfortable lunging in the harness, it's time to move on to working with long lines. Long lines give you more flexibility in guiding and directing your horse while they are wearing the harness. This step is vital in preparing your horse for the next and final phase of the training process, ground driving.

This method develops your horse's steering and responsiveness to the commands you give while driving. It's essential to have a good foundation in lunging and working with long lines before starting this step. In conclusion, introducing your horse to a driving harness is a process that requires patience, skill, and professional assistance.

Create a prenuptial agreement. Feed your retirement accounts. Create a legal proxy, like a company. Buy life insurance.","completion":"When it comes to financial planning, it's always better to be prepared for the worst. No one likes to think about unfortunate events such as divorce, illness, or even death, but they can happen at any time. That's why it's essential to have a backup insurance plan in place that can provide financial support in such cases. One of the best ways to minimize risk is to create a prenuptial agreement before getting married. Although it might feel uncomfortable to talk about financial matters before getting married, it can save a lot of trouble in the future. It's essential to have an agreement that outlines how assets and debts will be divided in case of a marital split. Apart from having a prenuptial agreement, it's crucial to feed your retirement accounts. No matter how far into the future it feels, retirement will come sooner than you think. So, it's never too early to start investing in a 401(k), IRA, or another retirement fund. The more you save, the better off you'll be in the long run. Another important aspect of financial planning is to create a legal proxy, such as a company, to protect assets. In case of a lawsuit or another legal issue, the company can shield assets and personal finances from being impacted. It's essential to consult with a legal professional to create a robust legal proxy. Lastly, buying life insurance is another critical step in financial planning. It offers a safety net for your loved ones in case of untimely death. Life insurance can cover any outstanding debts, mortgage payments, or living expenses for your family members. In conclusion, financial planning is all about being prepared for the worst possible outcome. By creating a backup insurance plan, a prenuptial agreement, feeding retirement accounts, creating a legal proxy, and buying life insurance, you can significantly reduce the financial impact of unfortunate situations."},{"prompt":"'s almost 9 P.M. here , We ' ve had our dinner a few hours ago and now I ' m trying to do something on the computer while my baby is in his daddy 's lap .

A Polish nobleman living at the time prior to the 15th century was referred to as a rycerz, very roughly equivalent to the English knight, the critical difference being the status of rycerz was almost strictly hereditary; the class of all such individuals was known as the rycerstwo.

He appeared to refer to John Hirst, who killed his landlady with an axe, in his argument for allowing prisoners to vote. Mahoney believes that the UK should back down over its refusal to allow prisoners to vote, citing it as a violation of their human rights. This statement has been met with criticism, with many arguing that convicted murderers have forfeited their right to participate in the democratic process. However, Mahoney argues that denying prisoners the right to vote is akin to denying them their basic human rights. The debate over prisoner voting rights has been ongoing for years. In 2005, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the UK’s blanket ban on prisoner voting was a breach of human rights. Despite this ruling, the UK has continued to refuse to allow prisoners to vote. Mahoney’s comments have added fuel to the fire, with many calling for a reconsideration of the prisoner voting ban. However, others argue that allowing prisoners to vote would be a step too far, especially when it comes to those convicted of violent crimes.

However, despite being recognized as the legitimate government by many regional warlords and foreign nations, it took several years for the Beiyang Government to gain full recognition as the government of China. The first major obstacle to recognition was the Warlord Era, a period of chaos and instability in China characterized by the rise of regional military leaders who controlled their own territories and armies. Many of these warlords did not recognize the authority of the Beiyang Government, and some actively opposed it. This made it difficult for the government to exercise control over the entire country and establish itself as the sole legitimate authority. Furthermore, the Beiyang Government's legitimacy was challenged by the emergence of other political groups and factions, such as the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang. These groups often saw the Beiyang Government as corrupt and ineffective, and sought to establish their own rule over China. Despite these challenges, the Beiyang Government gradually gained more recognition over the years. In 1915, Japan recognized the government as the legitimate authority over China, and many other foreign nations followed suit. However, full recognition was not achieved until 1928, after the Northern Expedition led by the Kuomintang overthrew the warlords and unified much of China under the government's control. In conclusion, it took the Beiyang Government several years to be fully recognized as the government of China.

The ROC was established in 1912, after the Qing dynasty fell, and it ruled mainland China until 1949. In that year, communist forces led by Mao Zedong defeated the Nationalist forces led by Chiang Kai-shek, and the PRC was proclaimed on October 1, 1949. The PRC and the ROC still exist today, but the PRC is recognized by most countries as the legitimate government of China, while the ROC controls only the island of Taiwan and a few smaller islands. The PRC's rise to power had a significant impact on the political, economic, and social landscape of China, and it led to profound changes in Chinese society. One of the most significant changes brought by the PRC was the introduction of a socialist system. Mao Zedong instituted policies that sought to eliminate the power of landlords and capitalists and transfer wealth and power to the peasants and workers. The PRC also implemented a planned economy that emphasized the production of heavy industry and centralized economic control. The first years of the PRC were marked by great social upheaval, as Mao Zedong launched the Great Leap Forward, a massive campaign to rapidly industrialize the economy and modernize the country. However, this policy led to serious economic problems and millions of deaths from famine. Subsequent leaders, including Deng Xiaoping, who rose to power in the late 1970s, sought to reform the economy by introducing some capitalist elements, encouraging foreign investment, and promoting a more decentralized economic system. Today, the PRC is the world's most populous country and a major economic and political power. Its rise to prominence has had a profound impact on the world, shaping economic and political systems far beyond its borders. Despite ongoing tensions and disputes with other countries, including the United States, the PRC is likely to remain a major force on the international stage for years to come."},{"prompt":"Question 1: How much initial capital would you need to become an investor successfully like warren buffet if you are 21?
