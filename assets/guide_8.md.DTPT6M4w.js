In a second clip, Lin treats Thomas to a number of luxuries, including a haircut, a new outfit, and a meal at a restaurant.

Lilius's proposal resulted in an average year of 365.2425 days (see Accuracy).

It's quick fix for tricky social, cultural issues don't buy it, they say. They say the policy expects women to be flexible, not companies. Writers: Instead, demand policies that ease the workplace strain for mothers, fathers.","completion":"Apple and Facebook recently made waves by offering coverage for women employees to freeze their eggs. The companies argue that this is a quick fix for the tricky social and cultural issues around motherhood in the workplace. However, many writers have cautioned against buying into this policy as a solution. Critics argue that by offering egg freezing, the policy is placing the responsibility on individual women to plan their fertility around their careers. Instead, they argue, companies should be implementing policies that ease the strain on working mothers and fathers. For example, offering greater flexibility in work hours or location, or guaranteeing benefits such as paid parental leave. In an ideal world, women wouldn't have to choose between their careers and motherhood. By offering egg freezing, companies are tacitly accepting this false dichotomy. Rather than investing in reproductive technology, companies should be investing in creating a more equitable workplace that supports women, parents, and caregivers. Of course, the decision to freeze one's eggs is a personal one, and for some women it may be a welcome option. But it should not be seen as a solution to the larger problems of balancing work and parenthood. Companies should be held accountable for policies that ensure their employees can lead fulfilling lives both on and off the job. By demanding more comprehensive solutions, writers can help shape a brighter future for all working parents."},{"prompt":"Generate a descriptive sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = Fitzbillies, food = Italian, near = The Six Bell","completion":"Fitzbillies is an Italian restaurant located near The Six Bells."},{"prompt":"NORTH AUGUSTA, SC Liselotte Neumann won her first LPGA Tour title in six years, holding off a late charge by Grace Park for a threestroke victory at the LPGA Asahi Ryokuken International Championship on Sunday.

According to the figures obtained from the Corporation's central booking system, the corporation ran up a taxi bill of nearly £31,450 a day or 236,675 license fees. The figures show that BBC spent £10.7 million in 2011-12, £11.8 million in 2012-13 and £11.9 million in 2013-14 on taxis alone. What caught the attention of many is the staggering amount of over £200,000 being spent on taxis that were cancelled on arrival. It is a matter of concern that this type of carelessness is not rare within the Corporation, indicating a need for the proper management of its finances. It must be noted that the actual amount spent on taxis could even be higher than the figures revealed, as staff members can book taxis themselves and claim the money back on expenses. This loophole makes the total amount spent on taxis by the Corporation something that is of grave concern. Such a degree of spending on taxis efficiently highlights the mismanagement of the finances within the corporation. The improper management of financial resources and funds can lead to further setbacks and reductions within the corporation. The Corporation ought to bring in new measures and policies to ensure that such malpractices do not happen in the future. The issue of the BBC’s taxi bills creates unease among the public as these costs ultimately contribute to the license fee they pay. To gain back public trust, the Corporation needs to reassess its policies and procedures concerning the use of taxis by staff members. It is only by doing so that the BBC can demonstrate a commitment to using its resources wisely and being accountable to the public it serves."},{"prompt":"Does Crystals of ZnS are used in lasers that operate in the midinfrared part of the spectrum. correctly answer the question of What kind of lasers are crystals of zinc suflde used in?

According to data from the World Bank, the unemployment rate in the U.S. was 8.1%, while in Japan it was only 4.3%. This difference in unemployment rates can be attributed to various factors. One of the reasons for the difference in unemployment rates is the economic policies of each country. The U.S. was still recovering from the 2008 financial crisis, which had a significant impact on the job market. During this period, many companies were forced to reduce their workforce, resulting in an increase in unemployment. Japan, on the other hand, had implemented policies to address their high unemployment rate after their financial crisis in the late 1990s, including increasing public spending and creating a flexible labor market. Another factor contributing to the difference in unemployment rates is the level of education and skills of the workforce. In the U.S., many people without a college degree have been unable to find stable employment, while in Japan, there is a greater emphasis on vocational training programs that prepare workers for specific jobs. Lastly, the demographic composition of each country can also impact the unemployment rate. Japan's rapidly aging population has resulted in a shrinking labor force, which has led to a lower unemployment rate. In contrast, the U.S. has a larger, more diverse population with varying levels of education and skills. Overall, the unemployment rate in the U.S. was higher than in Japan in 2012. While various factors contribute to the difference, a focus on economic policies, education, and demographics may help improve the job market in both countries."},{"prompt":"(1) The FAA and ICAO are working on a Sonic Boom standard to enable supersonic flights overland .

He fears his weight will balloon when he retires from wrestling in 2014.","completion":"Manny Yarbrough, a former American sumo wrestler, weighs a staggering amount, three times as much as the world-renowned sprint champion Usain Bolt. The weight difference between the two is enormous, and it's hard to imagine any two human beings could be so different in size. But for Yarbrough, his immense weight has been a part of his life for as long as he can remember. Yarbrough's concerns about his weight have only increased since he retired from wrestling in 2014. As an athlete, he had to maintain his weight and stay in form, but without the structure of competition, he fears that his weight may balloon. This concern is not uncommon among retired athletes, particularly those who have been known for their size or speed, and Yarbrough is right to be worried about his health. Carrying excess weight, as Yarbrough does, can cause a range of health problems, including diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and joint pain. But the risks are not only physical; being overweight can also impact mental health, causing depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. It's important that Yarbrough takes steps to manage his weight after retiring from wrestling. There are a number of ways that Yarbrough can manage his weight in retirement. He could start by adjusting his diet to reduce his calorie intake and include more fruits, vegetables, and whole foods. Physical exercise is also crucial in managing weight, so he might consider enlisting the help of a personal trainer to develop a workout program that suits his needs. It's important to note that managing weight is not an easy task, nor is it something that can be done overnight. For Yarbrough, it will be a lifelong effort, and it's essential that he finds a strategy that works for him. But with the right mindset and support, he can maintain his health and keep his weight under control. Ultimately, what matters most is that Yarbrough makes his health a priority, and takes the steps necessary to live a healthy and fulfilling life."},{"prompt":"for bush backers , the light they perceived at the end of the postelection day tunnel turned out to be an oncoming judicial freight train .

The Armistice was signed on November 11, 1918, effectively ending the hostilities on the Western Front. However, it would take several months of negotiations to finalize the terms of the peace treaty, known as the Treaty of Versailles. Meanwhile, the victorious Allied powers established a series of occupation zones in Germany, including the Rhineland region. At the time, Rhineland was a significant industrial hub and home to many of Germany's military installations, including its largest armaments factories. The four countries that occupied Rhineland were Belgium, France, United Kingdom, and the United States. Each country was responsible for controlling its designated region and maintaining order in the area. The occupation was supposed to last until the Treaty of Versailles was signed, ratified, and all reparations were paid in full. The French had the most significant presence in Rhineland, with troops stationed in the region until 1930. They believed that Germany posed a significant threat to their national security and sought to keep a close eye on the country as it rebuilt its military and economy. The French also implemented a series of measures to ensure that Germany could not rearm, including strict limitations on the size and scope of its military forces. Belgian forces also occupied a section of Rhineland, focused mainly in the east. Their presence was less militaristic but rather more economic. They aimed to ensure that Germany paid its war reparations under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. The United Kingdom's presence in Rhineland was short-lived, as they only occupied a small part of the region. Their focus was on disarming Germany and removing any potential threats to the British home countries. The United States also played a role in the Rhineland occupation, though it was more limited than the other three countries. US forces were responsible for the Koblenz region, and their presence was focused on maintaining stability in the area. In conclusion, after the Armistice of 1918, Rhineland was occupied by armies from four different countries: Belgium, France, United Kingdom, and the United States. They were responsible for maintaining order, disarming Germany and ensuring that the country paid its war reparations. The occupation lasted until 1930, and the region played a crucial role in shaping the future of Germany and Europe as a whole."},{"prompt":"The digestive system is the body system that digests food. It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.

Put treats out of sight. Schedule your workouts. Reduce stress. Plan a holiday workout routine. Keep warm.","completion":"With the holiday season fast approaching, many of us are already planning the feast that awaits us. However, as much as we all love indulging in these festive treats, it's essential to balance it out with some healthy habits. Here are some tips to help you stay on track this holiday season. Firstly, it's a good idea to go easy on the calories the week before the festivities begin. You don't need to be restrictive or skip meals, but try to stick to a healthy diet and avoid overeating as much as possible. This will make it easier to control your portions when you're faced with delicious treats later on. Next, put treats out of sight. With so many delicious treats around, it can be hard to resist temptation. To avoid overindulging, don't leave sweets and chocolates lying around in plain sight. Stash them away where you can't see them so that you won't be tempted to snack unnecessarily. Scheduling workouts is also a great way to stay on track over the holidays. Instead of using the busy season as an excuse to skip your gym routine, plan your workouts in advance so that you can still fit them in. Even if it's a quick 20-minute jog or a yoga session at home, every bit of exercise will help keep you on track. Reducing stress is also crucial during the holiday season. Make sure to take some time to relax and unwind, whether it's with a long soak in the bath, a good book, or some calming music. When you're feeling stress-free, it's easier to resist temptations and make healthy choices. It's also a good idea to plan a holiday workout routine to keep yourself motivated. Find a few workouts that you enjoy and that fit into your schedule, whether it's a yoga class, a dance session or a gym routine. As long as you're moving and staying active, you'll be making progress towards your health goals. Finally, keep warm during the cold winter months. One of the biggest reasons for skipping workouts or overindulging in comfort food is because we're feeling cold and miserable. Invest in some warm and comfortable workout gear, and make sure your home is heated to a comfortable temperature. When you're feeling warm and cozy, you'll be more motivated to stay active and make healthy choices. In conclusion, it's entirely possible to enjoy the holidays while maintaining a healthy lifestyle. By following these tips and making small adjustments to your routine, you can stay on track and avoid overindulging in festive treats. Remember, it's all about balance – so go ahead, enjoy that slice of pie, but make sure to balance it out with some healthy habits. Happy Holidays!"},{"prompt":"Read this and answer the question.

Allow the solution to sit for a minute or two, then let the mattress dry again completely before use.

However, the jury ultimately agreed with the defence's argument that Brooks was simply too \\"daft\\" to knowingly break the law. The prosecution had argued that Brooks had deliberately concealed the materials in a bid to obstruct the police investigation into phone hacking at News International. They claimed that this was evidence of a wider criminal conspiracy involving Brooks and his wife. However, the defence sought to paint a different picture of Brooks as a bumbling, naive man who had acted without thinking. They argued that he had simply hidden the materials out of embarrassment rather than with any intention to deceive the police. In the end, the jury sided with the defence's version of events, acquitting Brooks of all charges. But the case raised questions about the extent to which ignorance or stupidity can be used as a defence in criminal trials. Some legal experts have argued that allowing defendants to claim ignorance of the law could lead to a slippery slope where anyone accused of a crime could simply claim that they didn't know any better. Others have pointed out that this defence has long existed in English law, under the principle of mens rea (or guilty mind).

In some very mobile and active polychaetes the brain is enlarged and more complex, with visible hindbrain, midbrain and forebrain sections. The rest of the central nervous system is generally ladderlike, consisting of a pair of nerve cords that run through the bottom part of the body and have in each segment paired ganglia linked by a transverse connection.

Miliband claims that the proposal was drawn up hastily, dubbing it something that was put together \\"on the back of a fag packet\\" by the UK PM. Miliband, whose party has 41 MPs in Scotland, argued that the proposal would lead to \\"our Parliament being split up\\", something he is \\"not in favour of a Commons that becomes divided\\". The debate over Scottish independence has put significant pressure on the political parties to address the West Lothian question, the issue of Scottish MPs being able to vote on laws relating only to England in the UK Parliament. Miliband's attempt to keep the UK Parliament unified, and his reservations about \\"English votes for English laws,\\" are understandable in this context. Furthermore, while there is a good deal of support for greater devolution for Scotland, that does not necessarily translate to calls for such devolution for England. Cameron has been arguing that if Scotland gets new powers, so should England. However, the Labour leader's concerns about a split parliament are likely shared by many in the House of Commons. It is worth noting that the issue of Scottish independence is far from over, and the eventual outcome will likely have a significant impact on the next general election. With 41 MPs in Scotland, Labour could potentially form a majority government next year, something that may add to the debate over the West Lothian question. Overall, Miliband's cautious approach to addressing the issue of English devolution is understandable, given the pressures on the UK Parliament following the Scottish independence referendum.

He concluded that this outcome was unlikely to have occurred by chance, and that therefore, the method was tending to produce bipartite stemmas regardless of the actual history of the witnesses.

The Slavs had no written language, so the brothers devised the Glagolitic alphabet, later developed into Cyrillic, and standardized the language of the Slavs, later known as Old Church Slavonic. They translated portions of the Bible and drafted the first Slavic civil code and other documents, and the language and texts spread throughout Slavic territories, including Kievan Rus’.

Select a bold statement for a dynamic introduction. Choose a simple story to illustrate where your writing will go. Write an example for a concrete way to introduce your topic. Opt for a broad statement for a straightforward approach. Ask a question to get the reader thinking. Avoid starting with a definition unless it is truly relevant.","completion":"\\"First impressions are everything\\" – Unknown. When it comes to writing, the first impression a reader has of your article can either make or break its success. This is why it's essential to start with a strong introduction that grabs the reader's attention and compels them to continue reading. There are several ways to achieve this. One approach is to begin with a quote that succinctly sums up the topic of your article. For example, \\"Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower\\" by Steve Jobs could be used for an article on the importance of innovation in business. Another effective method is to make a bold statement that immediately piques the reader's interest. For instance, \\"The sky is not blue\\" could be used for an article on the science of color perception. A simple story can also be an impactful way to introduce your topic. Suppose you're writing about the benefits of a plant-based diet. In that case, you could start by sharing a personal anecdote about how switching to a vegetarian lifestyle improved your health and well-being. Providing a concrete example is yet another effective approach. For an article on the importance of goal-setting, you could use a real-life example of a successful athlete or entrepreneur who attributed their achievement to setting and achieving specific goals. If you prefer a more straightforward approach, a broad statement can be a great way to introduce your article. For example, \\"In today's fast-paced world, stress is a common problem that affects millions of people,\\" could be used for an article on stress reduction techniques. Asking a question is another effective way to engage the reader and get them thinking. For an article on the future of technology, you could begin by asking, \\"What will the world look like in 10 years, and how will technology shape our lives?\\" Finally, it's best to avoid starting with a definition unless it's absolutely necessary. While definitions can help clarify complex terms, they're not always the most exciting way to start an article. Suppose you're writing about a medical condition or scientific theory that requires a definition. In that case, it's crucial to keep it brief and use language that's accessible to the average reader. In conclusion, as a writer, you have several options when it comes to introducing your article. Selecting a compelling approach that best aligns with the content will create a strong impression on the reader, ultimately leading to an outstanding piece of writing."},{"prompt":"Question 1: What are some cool potential applications of IBM Watson in the logistics industry?

This was not always the case, however: the Catholic Church has gone through several phases in kinship prohibitions. At the dawn of Christianity in Roman times, marriages between first cousins were allowed. For example, Emperor Constantine, the first Christian Roman Emperor, married his children to the children of his halfbrother. First and second cousin marriages were then banned at the Council of Agde in AD 506, though dispensations sometimes continued to be granted. By the 11th century, with the adoption of the socalled canonlaw method of computing consanguinity, these proscriptions had been extended even to sixth cousins, including by marriage. But due to the many resulting difficulties in reckoning who was related to whom, they were relaxed back to third cousins at the Fourth Lateran Council in AD 1215. Pope Benedict XV reduced this to second cousins in 1917, and finally, the current law was enacted in 1983.

However, upon closer examination, we can determine a rough estimate of the time frame. To begin, we must define what is meant by the first and last rebellion. Depending on the context, there may be multiple potential rebellions to consider. For example, in the history of the United States, one might consider the first rebellion to be the American Revolution in the late 1700s, while the last rebellion could be the Civil War in the mid-1800s. Assuming we are referring to a specific context, such as a particular country or region, we can begin to examine historical records and accounts of rebellions. It is important to note that rebellions may take many forms and may not always be labeled as such in historical documentation. However, we can look for instances of unrest, uprisings, and resistance movements that may fall under the umbrella of rebellion. Once we have identified the relevant rebellions, we can calculate the time elapsed between the first and last. Depending on the frequency and duration of rebellions in the region, this time frame may vary considerably. Additionally, the causes and outcomes of rebellions may also affect the time between them. For example, if a successful rebellion leads to significant changes in the political or social system, subsequent rebellions may be less likely to occur or may take different forms. In conclusion, determining the exact number of years between the first and last rebellion is a complex task that depends on the specific context and historical records.

Avoid containers made from hazardous plastics. Clean the containers thoroughly. Disinfect water from unsafe sources Filter out contaminants.","completion":"Storing Water: A Guide to Ensuring Clean and Safe Drinking Water When it comes to preparing for emergencies, having access to clean and safe drinking water is essential. However, not all sources of water are reliable, and unclean water can lead to serious health problems. Therefore, it is important to store water ahead of time, and take the necessary precautions to ensure that it is safe to drink. The first step in storing water is to decide how much you need. The general recommendation is to have at least one gallon of water per person per day, with a minimum of three days’ worth of water stored. However, depending on your family size and needs, you may want to store more. Bottled water is an easy and convenient way to store water. Look for water that comes in sturdy, reuseable containers made from materials such as glass or food-grade plastic. Avoid containers made from hazardous plastics, such as those that contain bisphenol-A (BPA), a chemical that can seep into the water and cause health problems. If you choose to store water in your own containers, make sure they are thoroughly cleaned and disinfected first. Use soap and warm water to scrub the inside and outside of the container, then rinse it well with hot water. To disinfect the container, mix a solution of one teaspoon of unscented household bleach per quart of water, fill the container with the solution, and let it sit for at least 30 seconds before rinsing it out completely. If you need to use water from an unsafe source, such as rainwater, a stream, or a well, you should filter out any contaminants before drinking it. There are many types of filters available, from simple straws that you can use to drink straight from the source, to more advanced gravity-fed systems that can filter out bacteria, viruses, and other harmful particles. In summary, storing water for emergencies can be a lifesaving decision, but it is important to take the necessary steps to ensure that the water is clean and safe to drink. Decide how much water you need, consider using bottled water or safe containers, clean and disinfect containers thoroughly, and filter out any contaminants from unsafe sources. With these precautions in place, you can rest assured that you and your family will have access to clean and safe drinking water in times of need."},{"prompt":"w would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? @Gingernyc That would great!

They theorized that pain intensity (the sensory discriminative dimension) and unpleasantness (the affectivemotivational dimension) are not simply determined by the magnitude of the painful stimulus, but higher cognitive activities can influence perceived intensity and unpleasantness. Cognitive activities may affect both sensory and affective experience or they may modify primarily the affectivemotivational dimension. Thus, excitement in games or war appears to block both dimensions of pain, while suggestion and placebos may modulate the affectivemotivational dimension and leave the sensorydiscriminative dimension relatively undisturbed. (p. 432) The paper ends with a call to action: Pain can be treated not only by trying to cut down the sensory input by anesthetic block, surgical intervention and the like, but also by influencing the motivationalaffective and cognitive factors as well.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Last week's midterm election saw a shocking lack of voter turnout, with some sources suggesting that it was the lowest since the 1940s. However, there were some small gains made by the GOP with Latino and Asian-American voters. Political commentator Eric Liu believes that if political parties want to avoid voter apathy, they need to compete for voters in all groups. This means making a conscious effort to connect with minority groups and address their concerns in a meaningful way. By investing time and resources into these communities, political parties can build trust and solidarity with groups that have traditionally been overlooked. While the GOP's gains with Latino and Asian-American voters may seem modest, they are a step in the right direction. By reaching out to these groups and engaging with their concerns, the GOP has shown a willingness to expand their base beyond their traditional demographic. If they can build on this momentum and continue to connect with diverse communities, they may find that they have a stronger foothold in future elections. Ultimately, the key to beating voter apathy is to listen to voters' concerns and take action to address them. By doing so, political parties can build trust and engagement with all voters, regardless of their background or identity.

If so, you're not alone. However, did you know there's an easy solution to minimize these pesky calls? It's called signing up for the National Do Not Call Registry. The National Do Not Call Registry is a free service provided by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the United States. The registry was developed to help consumers avoid unwanted telemarketing calls. By signing up, you can reduce the number of telemarketing calls you receive. Additionally, some states have their own Do Not Call lists, which can further prevent unwanted calls. Be sure to check if your state has its own list, as they may have different rules or exemptions. While the Do Not Call Registry can greatly reduce the number of unwanted calls, it's important to note that it doesn't necessarily stop all calls. You may still receive calls from political organizations, charities, or companies you have an existing business relationship with. If you still receive calls from unwanted telemarketers despite being registered on the Do Not Call list, don't hesitate to ask them to remove your number from their calling list. Under the FTC's Telemarketing Sales Rule, telemarketers are required to honor do not call requests. If they continue to call you, you can report them to the FTC. It's also important to be cautious about sharing your phone number, especially online or in public spaces. Some companies may request your phone number when making purchases or signing up for services. Beware of providing your phone number for unnecessary reasons, as this can increase the likelihood of receiving unwanted calls. In conclusion, signing up for the National Do Not Call Registry is a simple solution to avoid unwanted telemarketing calls. Other steps, such as checking if your state has its own list, asking telemarketers to remove your number, and being cautious about sharing your number, can further reduce the number of unwanted calls."},{"prompt":"Write a positive tweet.","completion":"\\"Today is a new day full of opportunities and possibilities.
