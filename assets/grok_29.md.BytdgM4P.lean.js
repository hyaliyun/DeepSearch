There were gods of the upper heavens, gods of the underworld and a myriad of lesser deities between. Some evidently favoured Rome because Rome honoured them, but none were intrinsically, irredeemably foreign or alien. The political, cultural and religious coherence of an emergent Roman superstate required a broad, inclusive and flexible network of lawful cults.

His charges stem from the violence during the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Karadzic disguised himself and hid in plain sight for more 13 years before his capture. He could face life in prison if convicted. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Radovan Karadzic, the former leader of the Bosnian Serbs, is currently facing charges related to the Srebrenica massacre, where around 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed. The massacre occurred during the violent breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Karadzic, who had been in hiding for over 13 years and had disguised himself, was finally captured and brought before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague. If convicted, Karadzic could face life in prison. The Srebrenica massacre is considered to be one of the worst atrocities committed in Europe since World War II. The UN had declared the town a safe haven and had stationed peacekeeping troops there to protect the civilians. However, when the Bosnian Serb army, led by Karadzic, attacked the town, the peacekeeping troops were unable to stop the massacre. Karadzic had evaded capture for over a decade, living under an assumed identity and even practicing as a doctor in Serbia. He was finally caught in 2008 and extradited to The Hague to face trial. The trial has been ongoing since 2009, and Karadzic has denied all charges against him. However, witnesses have testified against him, providing evidence linking him to the massacre. The trial has been closely watched, not just in Bosnia, but around the world. It is hoped that a conviction will bring some measure of justice to the victims and their families. In conclusion, the trial of Radovan Karadzic is a reminder of the brutal violence that occurred during the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. The Srebrenica massacre in particular stands as a tragic symbol of the atrocities committed during that time. The outcome of the trial will have significant implications, not just for Karadzic, but also for the victims and their families."},{"prompt":"Write a title: The United States edged past world champions Germany in a dramatic 21 victory to seal their place in the women #39;s football final.","completion":"USWNT Beats Germany 2-1 to Advance to Women's Football Final."},{"prompt":"yderabad In 1713 Farrukhsiyar, the Mughal emperor, appointed Asif Jah I to be Viceroy of the Deccan, with the title NizamulMulk (Administrator of the Realm).

It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface.

My heart's been ripped out, one victim's mother says at sentencing hearing.","completion":"James Arthur Ray, a self-help guru, was recently sentenced to a total of two years in prison for his involvement in a ceremony that led to the deaths of three people in 2009. The sentencing hearing took place in Yavapai County, Arizona, and was emotional for all involved. At the hearing, one of the victim's mothers expressed her pain, saying, \\"My heart's been ripped out.\\" It is clear that the tragic loss of her child still weighs heavily on her, even after all these years. This sentiment was echoed by the families of the other victims, who also spoke at the hearing. The ceremony in question was meant to be a spiritual cleansing, but it quickly turned deadly when participants were instructed to enter a makeshift sweat lodge. The heat inside the lodge became unbearable, and several people soon became sick. Despite calls for help, Ray refused to let anyone leave, insisting that it was all part of the experience. Eventually, three people died from heat exhaustion, and several others were hospitalized. Ray was charged with three counts of manslaughter and later convicted. Throughout the trial, Ray maintained that he was not responsible for the deaths, insisting that the participants knew the risks of the ceremony. However, the judge ultimately disagreed, stating that Ray's conduct was reckless and showed a disregard for human life. The sentencing of James Arthur Ray marks the end of a long and tragic chapter. While no sentence can bring back the lives lost or ease the pain of the families affected, it is hopeful that justice has been served. It is a reminder that those who prey on vulnerable individuals for personal gain must be held accountable for their actions."},{"prompt":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: Democratic Party (United States), headquarter, Washington, D.C.","completion":"The iconic headquarters of the Democratic Party (United States) located in the bustling capital city of Washington, D.C. is a monumental symbol of political power and influence, serving as a pivotal hub for strategizing and coordinating crucial political campaigns, policy initiatives, and legislative agendas."},{"prompt":"Summarize the following: Consume at least ½ a lemon each day by whatever means you prefer.

Wipe off any excess denatured alcohol with a paper towel.","completion":"Removing Paint Stains from Hardwood Floors with Denatured Alcohol If you've accidentally spilled paint on your hardwood flooring, don't worry – it's not a lost cause! With the right technique, you can remove the paint stain and restore your floor's natural beauty. One effective method for removing paint stains from hardwood floors is to use denatured alcohol. Here's how you can use denatured alcohol to remove paint stains from your hardwood floor: 1. Blot denatured alcohol onto the stain using a rag. Saturate the stain with enough denatured alcohol to fully cover it. 2. Let the denatured alcohol soak into the paint stain for several minutes. The alcohol will penetrate the stain and help break down the paint. 3. Use a scrub brush to scrub the paint off the hardwood floor. For best results, use a stiff-bristled brush and scrub in a circular motion. Be sure to scrub gently so as not to damage the hardwood. 4. Rub off the remaining paint using the rag with denatured alcohol on it. Continue blotting and rubbing until all of the paint is removed. 5. Wipe off any excess denatured alcohol with a paper towel. This will help to prevent any damage to the hardwood caused by the alcohol. While denatured alcohol can be an effective solution for removing paint stains from hardwood floors, it's important to use caution when handling it. Denatured alcohol is highly flammable and can be toxic if ingested or inhaled. Be sure to use protective gloves and work in a well-ventilated area. With a bit of patience and a careful touch, you can remove paint stains from your hardwood floor using denatured alcohol. So, don't despair if you've had a painting mishap – just follow the above steps and your floor will be looking good as new in no time!"},{"prompt":"w do I use TOR browser and where to download it and how safe is it?

In an attempt to support this claim, Bradstock shared a bizarre story involving Fairy Liquid. Bradstock explained that when she and Brooks were housemates, he was once obsessed with a spill on the kitchen floor. Despite her attempts to clean it up, he kept insisting that the floor remained sticky. According to Bradstock, Brooks used an entire bottle of Fairy Liquid in an attempt to remedy the situation. The end result was a kitchen that was not only covered in soap suds but also incredibly slippery.

He stated that he believes that his coming out will help change the Republican Party's opinion of same-sex unions. Richardson argues that gay people can actually strengthen the institution of marriage, rather than weaken it. Richardson acknowledges that his confession will probably \\"alienate a friend or two,\\" but he believes it is important to be true to oneself. He hopes that his decision to come out will inspire others in the Republican Party to do the same and help shift the party's views on LGBT rights. It is noteworthy that the Republican Party platform currently opposes same-sex marriage and endorses a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman. However, some political analysts speculate that as more and more Americans come out as LGBT, Republican positions on LGBT rights will have to change in order to remain popular with voters. Overall, Richardson's decision to come out is a brave one, and will likely help further the conversation on LGBT rights within the Republican Party.

Ask your ophthalmologist about an ocular angiogram. Get an optical coherence tomography. Consider an injection of antiVEGF agents. Look into using photodynamic therapy. Get medical attention immediately if you experience severe symptoms.","completion":"Protecting your vision is essential for overall wellbeing, and early detection of eye diseases is key to preventing vision loss. Regular visits to your ophthalmologist for eye exams are therefore critical. During these visits, your ophthalmologist may recommend different tests to check for eye conditions that could affect your vision. One test you may be asked to take a look at is the Amsler grid, which is a tool designed to help detect disorders of the central visual field. Using the grid, you can spot changes or abnormalities in your central vision that could point to macular degeneration, a condition that causes blurred vision or even blindness if left untreated. In some cases, your ophthalmologist may recommend an ocular angiogram, a diagnostic test that involves taking pictures of the blood flow in your eye. This test can help detect eye conditions such as macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and eye tumors, among others. Another test that can give your ophthalmologist a closer look at your eye is the optical coherence tomography (OCT). The OCT uses light waves to produce high-resolution images of different structures in your eyes, including the retina and the optic nerve. With these images, your ophthalmologist can detect eye conditions that may not be visible during a regular eye exam. If you are diagnosed with wet macular degeneration, your ophthalmologist may recommend an injection of anti-VEGF agents. These agents slow down or prevent new blood vessel growth in the eye, which could worsen your condition. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is another treatment option for wet macular degeneration. PDT involves injecting a medication into your body to make the abnormal blood vessels in your eye more sensitive to light. Next, your ophthalmologist uses a special laser to activate the medication and destroy the abnormal vessels. Finally, if you experience sudden vision loss, eye pain, or any other severe eye symptoms, it is crucial to seek medical attention immediately. Delaying could cause irreversible damage to your eyesight and worsen your condition. In conclusion, eye exams and regular visits to the ophthalmologist are vital for protecting your vision.

If the coil is impeded in any way, it can cause the motor to malfunction or even fail altogether. Therefore, it is important to remove or adjust anything that may be preventing the coil from spinning. One common issue that may prevent the coil from spinning is an imbalance in the motor. To address this issue, it is necessary to adjust the motor's balance by moving the paperclips. This may be done by moving the paperclips closer or further away from the center of the motor until it spins freely. In some cases, the coil may not start spinning even after the balance has been adjusted. In such cases, it may be helpful to give the coil a little spin manually to help it get started. This can be done by gently pushing the coil in the direction of its normal rotation. If the coil still does not spin even after it has been given a little push, it may be necessary to try spinning it in the opposite direction. This can help to dislodge anything that may be preventing the coil from spinning in the correct direction. In conclusion, ensuring that the coil in an electric motor is spinning freely is crucial to the proper functioning of the motor. If the coil is impeded in any way, it can cause the motor to malfunction or fail altogether. By removing or adjusting anything that prevents the coil from spinning, and by adjusting the motor's balance and giving the coil a little push or spin, it is possible to ensure that the motor runs smoothly and efficiently."},{"prompt":"ere are some concepts: cub, eat, salmon What is a sentence about these concepts?","completion":"The cub tried to eat the salmon."},{"prompt":"The Walloon Legion (French: Légion Wallonie ) was a collaborationist volunteer unit recruited from Belgium's Frenchspeaking population in Wallonia and Brussels during the German occupation of World War II.

Unfortunately, without knowing which game we are referencing, it is impossible to provide an accurate answer to this question. However, we can discuss the importance and role of field goals in football. Field goals are typically attempted when an offensive team cannot score a touchdown or wishes to take a safer option. A successful field goal scores three points for the team and can often change the momentum of a game. David Buehler, a former NFL kicker, was known for his strong leg and ability to score from long distances. He played for the Dallas Cowboys from 2009-2011, where he scored a total of 24 field goals in his 3-year career. In general, the number of yards scored in a field goal can vary based on the distance and placement of the attempt. The average length of a successful field goal is around 35-40 yards, although many kickers can score from farther distances with accuracy. In conclusion, while it is impossible to determine the exact number of yards of field goals David Buehler scored in a specific second half, it is important to recognize the significance of field goals in football and the contributions of skilled kickers like Buehler."},{"prompt":"What's an example of a movie review?","completion":"\\"Joker\\" is a truly remarkable film that explores the depths of mental illness and the consequences of societal neglect.

However, Abigail Thernstrom argues that the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court in 2009 rekindled contentious discussions about race and ethnicity. Thernstrom, who served on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, suggests that identity politics have persisted in the years since Obama’s election. She points to two pending Supreme Court cases that raise such issues: Fisher v. Texas and Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action. The former case involves affirmative action policies at the University of Texas and has already generated significant debate. The latter case addresses Michigan’s decision to ban race-based preferences in public university admissions. These cases, according to Thernstrom, demonstrate that controversy over ethnic and racial issues has not abated in the U.S. She suggests that discussions of these issues often become polarized and may hinder constructive dialogue. Nonetheless, she advocates for continued efforts to find common ground, noting that while ethnic and racial diversity causes division, it can also enrich society. Thernstrom’s assertions about lingering identity politics and affirmative action policies are being hotly debated across the U.S. Indeed, the country’s ongoing conversations about race and ethnicity reflect deeply ingrained values and beliefs.

Another factor that would have made conversion difficult in the Roman world was the halakhic requirement of circumcision, a requirement that proselytizing Christianity quickly dropped. The Fiscus Judaicus, a tax imposed on Jews in 70 CE and relaxed to exclude Christians in 96 CE, also limited Judaism's appeal. In addition, historians argue the very figure (4 million) that had been guessed to account for the population of Jews in the ancient Roman Empire is an error that has long been disproven and thus the assumption that conversion impacted Jewish population growth in ancient Rome on a large scale is false.

Exercise regularly. Avoid drugs and alcohol.","completion":"Getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and avoiding drugs and alcohol are three critical aspects of living a healthy and fulfilling life that cannot be overstated. Each of these practices can contribute to your overall well-being in a variety of ways, and together, they can help you achieve your goals and feel your best. First and foremost, getting enough sleep is essential for maintaining physical and mental health. Sleep helps us to recover from the day’s activities, repair any damage that our bodies have sustained, and recharge our brains for the next day. Lack of sleep has been linked to numerous health conditions, including heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and depression. It can also negatively impact our memory, attention span, and overall cognitive function. That’s why it’s important to prioritize sleep and aim for seven to nine hours of restful sleep per night. Regular exercise is another critical component of a healthy lifestyle. Exercise helps to strengthen our hearts, lungs, and muscles, as well as improve our cardiovascular health and immune function. It can also help to reduce stress and anxiety, improve our mood, and enhance our cognitive function. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise. Finally, it’s essential to avoid drugs and alcohol for optimal health. Drugs and alcohol can have severe negative consequences on our physical and mental health, as well as our relationships and finances. Substance abuse can lead to addiction, malnutrition, liver damage, heart disease, and other health problems. It can also impact our judgment, decision-making, and ability to function effectively in everyday life. In conclusion, getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and avoiding drugs and alcohol are fundamental to living a healthy and prosperous life. By taking care of yourself and making these practices a priority, you can achieve your goals, promote your overall well-being, and feel your best, both physically and mentally."},{"prompt":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Weltenbrand is a darkwave band from Liechtenstein formed in 1995 by Oliver Falk.

However, it wasn't until five years later, in 1958, that the show finally made its way to television. The show was created by Don Reid as a way to promote academic competition and scholarship among college students. The format of the show was simple but effective. Two four-person teams from different universities would compete against each other, answering questions on a variety of subjects. The teams would buzz in to answer the questions and score points for correct answers while also losing points for incorrect responses. The winning team would receive a prize, and the show proved to be very popular among college students and viewers alike. Despite its success, College Bowl faced some challenges over the years. In the 1970s, declining ratings and rising production costs led to the show's cancellation. However, it was later revived in the 1980s and continued to air in various forms well into the 21st century. In conclusion, College Bowl was shot as a pilot episode in 1953 but didn't make its way to television until 1958.

These holes electrically connect the conducting layers of the PCB. For multilayer boards, those with three layers or more, drilling typically produces a smear of the high temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system. Before the holes can be plated through, this smear must be removed by a chemical desmear process, or by plasmaetch. The desmear process ensures that a good connection is made to the copper layers when the hole is plated through.

McGregor explains that a man will get hired over a suitable women if she recently married. Women have to be noticeably better than men to get ahead.","completion":"The Gender Imbalance on Fortune 500 Boards Continues to be a Concern Despite the progress that has been made, the gender imbalance on Fortune 500 boards remains a concern. According to recent data, only 16.9 percent of board members are women, which is a slight increase from the previous year's figure of 16.6 percent. This means that women continue to be underrepresented in top leadership positions, and this has significant implications for gender equality and the economy. One reason for the lack of gender diversity on boards is bias. For instance, a study by Joanne Lipman found that women have to be noticeably better than men to get ahead. This bias also extends to marital status, as evidenced by the comments of the former chief executive of HBOS, James Crosby. According to Pat McGregor, who worked as a headhunter in the City of London, Crosby once said that he would hire a man over a suitable woman if she recently married. The reason was that women are more likely to have children, which would impact their commitment to work. This kind of thinking is not only outdated but also detrimental to women's career prospects. Another factor that contributes to the gender imbalance on boards is the pipeline issue. Many women do not make it to senior leadership positions because of the structural barriers in the workplace. For example, women may face discrimination in recruitment, promotion, and pay. They may also be excluded from networks and mentorship opportunities that are crucial for career advancement. As a result, there are fewer women available to fill board positions. To address this issue, there needs to be a concerted effort to promote gender diversity in the workplace. Companies should adopt policies that promote equal treatment, such as pay transparency and flexible working arrangements. They should also provide leadership training and mentorship opportunities for women, and establish networks that connect women with potential sponsors and mentors. Moreover, companies should set targets for gender diversity on boards and hold themselves accountable for achieving them. In conclusion, the gender imbalance on Fortune 500 boards remains a significant issue that needs to be addressed. Women continue to face barriers to entry and advancement in the workplace, and this has significant implications for the economy and society. It is time for companies to take proactive steps to promote gender diversity and inclusion, and this includes setting targets, adopting policies, and providing mentorship and leadership development opportunities for women. Only then can we achieve true gender equality in the workplace."},{"prompt":"girls i binged sooooo much on beer this weekend . honestly , i had about 600 calories a NIGHT on beer alone . plus i ate icecream too :( :( i m soooooo stupid ! i m never gon na get to my goal weight .

Critics of Atticus maintain he is morally ambiguous and does not use his legal skills to challenge the racist status quo in Maycomb. However, in 1997, the Alabama State Bar erected a monument to Atticus in Monroeville, marking his existence as the first commemorative milestone in the state's judicial history.

Pivot your torso toward the batter.","completion":"When it comes to pitching in baseball, following proper technique is crucial to achieving success. One of the key elements of pitching is maintaining a proper stance and targeting your pitch accurately. To start, stand in a normal pitching stance with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes pointing towards home plate. Next, aim for the batter's belt, which is typically the area just above their waistline. This will help you focus your pitch and increase your chances of throwing strikes. As you prepare to release the ball, begin winding up by bringing your throwing arm back behind your body. At the same time, pivot your torso towards the batter. This motion helps you generate power and momentum, which is essential for throwing fast and accurate pitches. It's important to remember to keep your eyes on the target as you wind up and release the ball. This will help you remain focused and deliver your pitch with precision. Additionally, maintain proper balance throughout your wind-up, keeping your weight evenly distributed between your front and back foot. In summary, to pitch accurately in baseball, it's important to maintain a proper stance, target your pitch towards the batter's belt, wind up while pivoting your torso, keep your eyes on the target, and maintain proper balance. By following these essential steps, you'll be well on your way to becoming a successful pitcher."},{"prompt":"By Steve Nolan and Leslie Larson PUBLISHED: 18:38 EST, 31 January 2013 | UPDATED: 20:02 EST, 31 January 2013 The Wall Street Journal said on Thursday that the company's computer system had been accessed by Chinese hackers.

Digestion is the process of breaking down food into nutrients. There are two types of digestion: mechanical digestion and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion occurs when large chunks are turned into smaller chucks. Perhaps not surprisingly, this happens when you chew your food. Once you swallow the food, your stomach also does some of this work. Chemical digestion occurs when food is broken down into useful nutrients. This is a chemical process that begins as you start to chew your food. The saliva in your mouth starts this process. Once you swallow, the acid in your stomach further breaks down food. From the stomach, the foods moves into the small intestine. In the small intestines, another set of chemicals goes to work. Are you surprised?

However, like any other shoes, they require maintenance to stay in good condition for longer. Here is a complete guide on how to take care of your Sperrys. Remove Caked-On Dirt Over time, dirt and grime can accumulate on your Sperrys, leaving them looking grimy and unattractive. A bristle brush is the best tool to remove caked-on dirt from your shoes. Take some time to work on the soles and uppers, using gentle but firm strokes to remove dirt and grime. Rub Away Scuffs Scuffs can appear on your Sperrys, especially if you wear them often. Removing scuffs is easy and straightforward. Use water and soap to remove any scuffs on your shoes. Take a damp cloth or sponge, add some soap, and rub the scuffed area gently until the mark disappears. Dry Your Sperrys Wet shoes are never fun to wear, and Sperrys are no exception. After cleaning your shoes, make sure you dry them thoroughly. Stuff them with newspapers or use a shoe tree to speed up the drying process. Avoid using heat sources as they can damage the leather. Apply Leather Conditioner Sperrys are made of leather, which requires conditioning to keep it supple and soft. A good quality leather conditioner helps to prevent cracking and protects your shoes from dirt and stains. Using a leather conditioner also helps to extend the life of your Sperrys. Use a small amount of conditioner and apply it evenly over the shoes, using circular motions. Shine and Buff Your Shoes Shining your Sperrys is not necessary, but it can enhance their appearance and make them look more polished. A microfiber cloth is an excellent tool to buff and shine your shoes. Apply some leather polish and buff the shoes gently. The result will be shiny, polished shoes that look as good as new. Take Special Care with Suede Shoes Suede Sperrys require special care to maintain their texture and look. Unlike leather shoes, you should avoid using water and soap on suede. Instead, use a suede brush to restore the nap of the suede and remove any dirt or stains. To protect your suede shoes from water and stains, apply a suede protector spray. In conclusion, taking care of your Sperrys is easy and straightforward. With a little bit of maintenance and care, you can keep your shoes looking great and ensure that they last for years. With the right tools and products, you can maintain your shoes' quality and preserve their classic look, season after season."},{"prompt":"Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning?

As he approached the window to place his order, he noticed that there were seven mice scurrying around the bins nearby. Needless to say, this was not the kind of sight that anyone would expect to see at a fast-food restaurant. When asked for a comment about the incident, McDonald's stated that the presence of the mice was due to the \\"extensive\\" roadworks that are currently taking place in the area. While this may be a valid explanation, it does little to alleviate the concerns of customers who expect a certain level of cleanliness and hygiene from the establishments that they visit. To their credit, McDonald's did take action in response to the incident. The company stated that it has increased its litter patrols, placed traps in the area, and conducted additional inspections to ensure that there are no further infestations. It is also worth noting that this is not the first time that the chain has had to deal with issues of this nature, as similar incidents have been reported at other locations around the country. Of course, incidents like this serve as a reminder of the importance of maintaining clean and hygienic conditions in all public spaces. Whether it is a fast-food restaurant or any other kind of establishment, it is the responsibility of the owners and managers to ensure that their premises are free from pests and other health hazards. This not only ensures the well-being of customers, but it also helps to maintain the reputation and credibility of the business itself. In the case of McDonald's in Tyburn, it is good to see that the chain has taken swift action to address the issue of the mice. However, it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Ultimately, it is up to all of us to be vigilant and hold businesses accountable for the standards of cleanliness and hygiene that they maintain."},{"prompt":"What is the answer: Name the Nuclear powered submarine which sank the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano on May 2nd 1982.","completion":"The nuclear powered submarine which sank the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano on May 2nd 1982 was HMS Conqueror."},{"prompt":"Monica: Ross, do you have an Umbrella??
