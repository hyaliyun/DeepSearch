With the Raptors leading the series 3-2, Game 6 in Oakland was a do-or-die situation for the Warriors. Despite a valiant effort, the defending champions couldn't overcome the absence of Kevin Durant, who ruptured his Achilles tendon in Game 5. However, the game's outcome was sealed in the final minutes by perhaps the most unforgettable moment of the series. With just under 3 minutes remaining and the Warriors trailing by one point, Stephen Curry received a pass and launched a three-pointer with the entire crowd holding its breath. The ball arced high into the air, seemingly destined to put the home team ahead. However, in what felt like slow motion, the ball rattled around the rim and out, bouncing harmlessly into the hands of the Raptors. The moment effectively ended the game and the series, as the Raptors quickly scored a basket on the other end to take a three-point lead. The Warriors did have several opportunities to tie or win the game in the closing moments, but they couldn't overcome the Raptors' determined defense, and the final score stood at 114-110 in favor of Toronto. It was a bittersweet moment for Stephen Curry and the Warriors, who had battled hard all series and had come up short. But for the Raptors and their fans, it was a moment of triumph and joy, as they won their first-ever NBA championship. In conclusion, the Stephen Curry missed shot in Game 6 of the 2019 NBA Finals will go down as one of the most memorable moments in recent NBA history."},{"prompt":"What is the process of changing a solid directly into a gas called?

The Adidas Ultra Boost Uncaged LTD was meant to be released as part of a wider collection of similarly colored sneakers. However, followers of the altright movement took to social media to claim that the shoes were a symbol of the white genocide conspiracy theory, which states that a global network of elites is attempting to eliminate the white race through multiculturalism, integration, and other nefarious means.","completion":"Adidas Pulls All-White Sneaker Over Fear of Offending Racist Sect Adidas has taken down an all-white running sneaker which was due to be launched on August 1st, amid concerns that it could potentially offend a racist group in America. The Adidas Ultra Boost Uncaged LTD was supposed to be released as part of a wider collection of similarly colored sneakers, but the alt-right movement caused a stir on social media, with claims that the shoes are a symbol of the white genocide conspiracy theory. This theory suggests that a global network of elites is attempting to eliminate the white race through various means, such as multiculturalism and integration. Adidas has taken swift action, hoping to avoid any controversy, by deciding to remove the all-white running sneaker from the collection. The company did not want the shoe to be perceived as offensive, as this goes against their brand values of inclusivity and equality. The decision to pull the sneaker highlights the challenges brands face with the rise of extremist groups and the need to navigate these concerning threats. Adidas is not the only brand that has been impacted by the alt-right movement. In 2016, New Balance made headlines when it was construed by some as endorsing Donald Trump after a company spokesperson said the president-elect's trade policies would help businesses in America. Consequently, many consumers bought New Balance shoes to support the brand, whilst others boycotted them. In summary, the decision to pull the all-white running sneaker by Adidas is a smart move. It shows that the company is aware of cultural sensitivities and respects the views of all its customers. It also highlights the challenges that brands face in a time when political extremism is on the rise. Brands need to be vigilant and proactive at all times to ensure their products do not inadvertently offend groups with dangerous ideologies and values."},{"prompt":"ere is a premise: The average height of an adult male is 5'10.

The country plans to produce 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2050. This includes solar, wind and hydroelectric power. Spain is already a world leader in renewable energy. The government hopes the plan will create new jobs and reduce carbon emissions.","completion":"Spain Plans to Achieve 100% Renewable Energy by 2050 Spain has recently announced its new renewable energy plan in which it aims to produce 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2050. The plan includes using solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to achieve this target. As a world leader in renewable energy, Spain hopes that this plan will help create new jobs and reduce carbon emissions. Currently, Spain is already producing a significant portion of its electricity from renewable energy sources. According to reports, by 2019, 43.6% of electricity in Spain was generated by renewable energy sources, including wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. However, the country aims to do more and has set a new target of achieving 100% of its electricity production from renewable sources by 2050. To reach its ambitious goal, Spain plans to invest in new technology, infrastructure, and research and development in the renewable energy sector. It is estimated that this plan will create thousands of new jobs and reduce carbon emissions, which will further contribute to the country’s efforts to combat climate change. One of the primary renewable energy sources that Spain will employ to achieve its target is solar power. Spain has been actively investing in solar energy for many years now and became the first country in the world to implement a national subsidy program for solar power back in 2007. Since then, it has steadily built its solar infrastructure to become one of the most significant solar energy producers globally. Spain has also been a leader in wind energy production and has around 24 GW of installed wind power capacity. It is the fourth-largest wind producer globally, and its wind energy sector has created thousands of jobs over the years. With the new renewable energy plan, Spain will continue to invest in its wind infrastructure to further expand its capacity. Spain’s use of hydroelectric power is also one of the significant contributors to its renewable energy goals. The country has more than 20 GW of total installed hydropower capacity, with around 13 GW coming from the mainland and the rest from the island territories. This helps reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and enables it to move further towards its renewable energy targets. In conclusion, Spain’s renewable energy plan has set an ambitious target for the country to achieve by 2050. It aims to become a world leader in renewable energy by relying on solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to achieve its goals. As a country that is already a significant producer of renewable energy, this plan will solidify its position as a global leader in the transition towards a cleaner, more sustainable future."},{"prompt":"Data: name = The Vegan Garden, eatType = café, food = vegan, priceRange = average, customer rating = excellent, familyFriendly = yes, near = children's museum.

In a recent game between the Eagles and the Cowboys, quarterback Carson Wentz faced high expectations and challenges against a divisional opponent. Wentz started the game with a solid completion to tight end Zach Ertz, but then threw a risky pass that was intercepted by Cowboys' safety Xavier Woods. That turnover gave the home team an early advantage and put pressure on Wentz to respond. However, he showed resilience and accuracy on his next drive, connecting with wide receivers Alshon Jeffery and Nelson Agholor for several first downs. Wentz also used his mobility to evade the pass rush and extend the play on multiple occasions, buying time for his receivers to get open. One of Wentz's best throws of the day came in the second quarter, when he launched a deep ball to Jeffery, who made a spectacular catch over cornerback Chidobe Awuzie for a 44-yard gain. That play set up a touchdown run by rookie running back Miles Sanders and gave the Eagles a 10-7 lead. Wentz continued to distribute the ball effectively among his targets, including Ertz, Agholor, and rookie J.J. Arcega-Whiteside, who caught his first career touchdown pass in the fourth quarter. However, Wentz also had some missed opportunities and mistakes that could have hurt the Eagles' chances. He overthrew a wide-open Agholor on a potential scoring play in the first half, and underthrew Ertz on a crucial third down in the fourth quarter that led to a punt. Wentz also took four sacks and fumbled twice, although he and his linemen recovered both of them. On the last drive of the game, the Eagles needed Wentz to engineer a comeback and tie or win the game, but he faced constant pressure and was unable to complete any of his four pass attempts, including a desperate heave to the end zone that was broken up by the defense. Overall, Wentz's performance against the Cowboys was a mixed bag, with some impressive highlights and critical mistakes. He completed 32 of 44 passes for 319 yards and a touchdown, but also had one interception and a passer rating of 91.2. While he showed his leadership and talent as a passer and runner, Wentz will need to improve his decision-making, accuracy, and pocket awareness to avoid costly errors and lead the Eagles to more victories this season."},{"prompt":"Summarize this passage: The latest research suggests that regular exercise can improve cognitive function and memory.","completion":"Regular exercise enhances cognitive function and memory, as per recent research."},{"prompt":"What are the adjectives in the sentence: The small, fluffy dog barked excitedly.","completion":"small, fluffy, excitedly"},{"prompt":"Compare and contrast the characteristics and functions of innate and adaptive immune responses.","completion":"Innate immune responses are a quick, general response to invading pathogens that occur immediately or within hours of exposure.

Here are some tips to keep yourself and your loved ones healthy during flu season: 1. Wash Your Hands Proper hand washing is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of the flu. Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Make sure to wash your hands frequently, especially after using the restroom or being in public places. 2. Get a Flu Shot Getting a flu shot can greatly reduce your chances of getting sick from the flu. It is recommended to get a flu shot every year, as the flu virus can change and evolve over time. Getting vaccinated not only protects you, but also helps protect others who may be more vulnerable to the flu. 3. Boost Your Immune System Eating a healthy diet is an important part of staying healthy during flu season. Foods such as citrus fruits, leafy greens, garlic, and ginger can help boost your immune system and fight off infections. Drinking plenty of water and getting enough sleep can also help keep your immune system strong. 4. Stay Home If you do get sick, it’s important to stay home and avoid spreading the flu to others. Resting and staying hydrated can help you recover faster, and prevent the flu from turning into a more serious illness. Flu season can be a challenging time, but with these tips, you can stay healthy and protect yourself from getting sick. Remember to wash your hands, get a flu shot, eat healthy foods, and stay home if you do get sick.

In the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll molecules in the thylakoid membranes absorb light energy, which is then used to split water molecules into oxygen gas and hydrogen ions. This produces ATP (adenosine triphosphate), a molecule that stores energy, and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), a molecule that carries energy. In the light-independent reactions or the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is used to synthesize glucose, using the energy obtained from ATP and NADPH, along with other enzymes and molecules involved in the process. The end result of this process is the production of oxygen as a byproduct and the synthesis of glucose, which is used as fuel for the plant's cellular processes."},{"prompt":"My mom equivalent to her in this sentence?

The study shows that more work needs to be done to achieve gender equality in the workplace.","completion":"Article: A recent report has revealed that women are still facing significant barriers to achieve leadership positions across many industries. Despite some progress being made in recent years, women are still underrepresented in leadership roles globally. According to the report, women account for less than a quarter of board directors worldwide, indicating that there is still a long way to go to achieve gender parity in workplaces. This figure is troubling since it suggests that women are not being given the same opportunities as men to hold key leadership roles within organizations. Experts point to several factors that contribute to this lack of representation, including systemic barriers and unconscious bias. These factors prevent women from accessing career development opportunities, including mentoring and sponsorship that could help them progress into senior leadership roles. This lack of support can leave women feeling undervalued, unsupported and believing that senior leadership is an unattainable goal. The report puts emphasis on the need for greater diversity and inclusion initiatives to address these challenges. Employers must create an environment in which women can achieve success and progress in their careers. This can be achieved by tackling unconscious bias, encouraging flexible working arrangements, and investing in training and development programs. The report also confirms that more work still needs to be done to achieve gender equality in the workplace. It is essential to encourage women to lead and to create pathways for women to take on leadership roles. This will enable companies to harness the full range of talent available to them, which could increase productivity, profitability, and innovation. To conclude, the report has brought to light some concerning realities. Women are still underrepresented in leadership positions, and unconscious bias, coupled with systemic barriers, contribute to this imbalance. Employers must take steps to address this issue, including creating opportunities for women to progress and supporting them in their development, ultimately achieving greater diversity and gender equality for all staff."},{"prompt":"Watch this video about the tallest building in the world and answer the questions below. 1.

Researchers from Stanford University have developed a pair of gloves that can simulate the sensation of holding different objects or even the feeling of water draining through the gloves. The system works by stimulating the nerves in the user's skin with careful vibrational patterns, which the brain then interprets as different textures or sensations. This could have a huge range of applications, making VR more immersive and allowing users to interact with virtual spaces in previously impossible ways. OPTIONS: This type of haptic technology has potential uses beyond entertainment, such as in medicine or engineering. The gloves can enhance the feeling of presence in virtual environments, which could have huge repercussions for VR design. Advancements like this could blur the lines between what is real and what is virtual, creating new possibilities for simulation and manipulation. Researchers will need to continue exploring how to create realistic interactions that can occur in predesigned virtual spaces. While the gloves have come a long way, enhancing VR design will require continued experimentation with more complex environments and interactions. These gloves could push virtual reality from a limited visual experience to an immersive sensory one. As this technology becomes more advanced and sophisticated, the prospect of a 'Matrix' type experience inches closer. We may be on the verge of a new age for VR, one where users can experience sensations and textures that are impossible in reality. By expanding virtual experiences to the tactile level, the gloves could have profound effects on stress and anxiety treatments.

The Earth's temperature has risen by approximately 1 degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution. This increase is largely due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. The consequences of climate change include rising sea levels, more frequent natural disasters, and the loss of biodiversity. Experts agree that urgent action is needed to mitigate the effects of climate change.","completion":"Title: Urgent Action Needed to Address Climate Change Introduction: Climate change is a significant environmental challenge faced by the global community today. The Earth's temperature has increased by approximately one degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution, largely due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. This research paper aims to examine the causes and consequences of climate change and stress the urgent need for action. Causes of Climate Change: The burning of fossil fuels and deforestation are the two primary causes of climate change. When we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas to generate energy or manufacture products, we release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Deforestation is also a significant contributor to climate change. As trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, cutting them down releases this carbon back into the environment. Consequences of Climate Change: The consequences of climate change are severe and far-reaching. One of the most significant effects is rising sea levels, which pose a threat to coastal communities worldwide. Climate change also leads to more frequent natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, and wildfires. Additionally, the loss of biodiversity threatens the ecosystems upon which we all depend for survival. Urgent Action Needed: Experts worldwide raise the alarm that immediate action is needed to mitigate the effects of climate change. Governments, businesses, and individual citizens must all take responsibility for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and protecting vulnerable ecosystems. Urgent action could include investing in renewable energy, implementing sustainable practices, and encouraging greener modes of transportation. Conclusion: In conclusion, climate change is indeed one of the most pressing issues facing the world today. The increase in Earth's temperature is a result of human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation. The consequences, including rising sea levels, natural disasters, and loss of biodiversity, are already being felt. It is imperative that urgent action is taken to mitigate the harmful effects and prevent further damage."},{"prompt":"Sentence: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, written by J.K.

The study, which followed over 70,000 women for several years, found that those who consumed a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains were less likely to experience hearing loss. The study's authors say that the findings suggest that diet may play an important role in reducing the risk of agerelated hearing loss.","completion":"Article: Eating a Healthy Diet May Reduce the Risk of Hearing Loss in Women A recent study has shed new light on the role of diet in reducing the risk of age-related hearing loss. The study, which followed over 70,000 women for more than two decades, found that those who consumed a healthy and balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains were less likely to experience hearing loss. The findings of the study were published in The Journal of Nutrition, and they suggest that a healthy diet can be an effective preventive measure against hearing loss, especially in women. Hearing loss is a common condition that affects millions of people around the world, and it can have a profound impact on the quality of life. The most common form of hearing loss is age-related, which means it happens gradually over time due to the natural aging process. In the study, researchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital followed 71,324 women between the ages of 27 and 44 from 1991 to 2013. The women were asked to complete a questionnaire about their diet every four years. The researchers also evaluated their hearing abilities every two years. The study found that women who consumed a healthy diet that included fruits, vegetables, and whole grains had a lower risk of hearing loss compared to those who did not. The researchers looked at specific nutrients that are known to be beneficial for hearing, such as folate, vitamin C, and magnesium, and found that women who had higher intakes of these nutrients had a lower risk of hearing loss. According to the study's lead author, Sharon Curhan, MD, \\"The association between diet and hearing sensitivity decline encompassed vitamins and minerals, and included several individually and jointly protective foods, suggesting that overall diet quality, rather than specific nutrients, may be more important in preserving hearing health.\\" The study's findings suggest that a healthy and balanced diet may be an effective preventive measure against age-related hearing loss, especially in women. The results are consistent with previous research that has shown a link between diet and hearing health. In conclusion, the study highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy and balanced diet, which can have a positive impact on overall health, including hearing health. The findings also suggest that dietary interventions may be a viable approach to reducing the risk of hearing loss in women."},{"prompt":"Write a question based on the following article: The Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Arizona Cardinals 2723 in Super Bowl XLIII.

Armstrong was accused of using performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) throughout his career and was eventually stripped of his seven Tour de France titles. The allegations against Armstrong included blood doping, using EPO, and taking corticosteroids. These allegations were backed up by multiple witnesses, including former teammates of Armstrong, who came forward with evidence of his drug use. Experts on doping and athletic performance testified in court, explaining how these drugs can increase an athlete's stamina and endurance, giving them an unfair advantage over their competitors. The use of PEDs is considered unethical and can also have serious health consequences for the athlete. The potential consequences for Armstrong were severe, including losing his titles, being banned from the sport, and facing legal charges.

However, with that access comes the danger of fake news and misinformation. This has led to concerns about the impact of social media on democracy and the public's ability to make informed decisions. Some believe that social media companies have a responsibility to address the problem, while others think that it is up to individual users to be more discerning. There are valid arguments on both sides of the debate. On the one hand, social media companies have created platforms that enable fake news and misinformation to spread rapidly. They have not done enough to regulate their platforms and prevent the dissemination of false information. This contributes to a growing sense of distrust towards news and information from social media, which can have a detrimental impact on democracy. On the other hand, some believe that individuals have a responsibility to be more critical of the information they consume. While social media companies can and should take steps to address the issue, ultimately it is up to individuals to assess the reliability of the news and information they see online. There are steps that social media companies can take to address the problem of fake news. For example, they can use algorithms to help identify and flag false information. They can also work with fact-checking organizations to verify the accuracy of content on their platforms. Furthermore, social media companies can provide users with better tools to evaluate the reliability of the information they see. Ultimately, the responsibility for addressing the problem of fake news lies with both social media companies and individual users.

These accusations have caused a stir in the entertainment industry, with several major film studios cutting ties with the actor. However, the actor has denied the allegations, leaving many to question the truth of the claims. This event is just one example of the impact that the #MeToo movement has had on society. The movement, which began in 2017, sparked a national conversation about sexual misconduct and the abuse of power in various industries. The movement aimed to shed light on the frequency of sexual harassment and assault, particularly in the workplace. As more and more individuals come forward with their experiences, it becomes increasingly clear that sexual harassment and misconduct is prevalent, and that it is not limited to one industry or group of people. This realization has led to a greater push for accountability and change, and for those responsible for such behavior to face consequences for their actions. While some may argue that false accusations of sexual harassment can cause undue harm and unfair consequences, it is important to acknowledge that the overwhelming majority of those who come forward with such claims do so with sincerity and courage. For many, speaking out against their abusers requires immense bravery, as they may fear retaliation, disbelief, or social ostracism. In conclusion, the accusations against the actor in question serve as a potent reminder of the importance of taking allegations of sexual misconduct seriously. It is essential for individuals and organizations alike to be accountable for their actions and to ensure that they are not perpetuating a culture of silence and abuse. The #MeToo movement has helped to catalyze this crucial conversation, and its impact is likely to be felt for many years to come."},{"prompt":"Which layer of the atmosphere is closest to the Earth’s surface?

The researchers say the technology could improve treatment outcomes and reduce the risk of longterm disability for concussion patients. How could this tool be used to improve treatment for individuals with traumatic brain injuries in developing countries with limited healthcare resources? Instructions: Write a proposal for implementing the concussion recovery prediction tool in a lowresource setting, addressing potential challenges and offering solutions.","completion":"Proposal for Implementing the Concussion Recovery Prediction Tool in Low-Resource Settings Introduction: Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are a global public health concern, and there is a need for accessible and effective tools to manage their treatment. The recent development of a new tool by researchers at McGill University that uses artificial intelligence to predict the recovery of concussion patients offers a promising solution in developed countries. However, there are challenges to implementing this tool in low-resource settings. This proposal explores how the tool could be used in developing countries to improve concussion treatment outcomes and reduce the risk of long-term disability. Challenges: 1. Lack of Resources: The lack of resources such as MRI machines, medical professionals, and trained personnel to operate the tool can be a barrier to implementation in low-resource settings. 2. Cultural Barriers: Cultural barriers, such as a lack of awareness about concussions or traditional attitudes towards brain injuries, may also pose a challenge. 3. Data Collection: The collection and management of data from patients will also be challenging, given the limited infrastructure and resources available. Solutions: 1. Integration with Existing Healthcare Facilities: The tool could be integrated into existing healthcare facilities with MRI machines, and medical professionals trained to use the tool could be employed to interpret scan results. 2. Public Awareness Programs: Engaging in public awareness campaigns to promote understanding and awareness of the risks and consequences of concussion, and emphasize the value of using the concussion recovery prediction tool to improve treatment outcomes. 3. Digital Solutions: Implementing digital data collection methods, such as mobile apps, that are user-friendly and accessible, can help with data collection from patients. Conclusion: Implementing the concussion recovery prediction tool in low-resource settings can significantly improve treatment outcomes for individuals with traumatic brain injuries. While there are challenges, such as lack of resources and cultural barriers, solutions such as integration with existing healthcare facilities, public awareness programs, and digital solutions exist to overcome these challenges. It is vital to prioritize the implementation of these solutions to ensure that everyone, irrespective of their location or resources, receives the best possible treatment outcomes for traumatic brain injuries."},{"prompt":"dentify the important words in the following sentence: A woman holding a bouquet of colorful flowers in a garden.","completion":"woman, holding, bouquet, colorful, flowers, garden."},{"prompt":"w can I make a DIY face mask using household items?","completion":"You can make a DIY face mask using a bandana or fabric, two elastic bands or hair ties, and a coffee filter.

As mass shootings continue to occur at an alarming rate, many people believe that stricter laws are necessary to prevent gun violence from happening again. On the other hand, some argue that the right to bear arms is protected by the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution. Many people believe that the solution to gun violence is stricter gun laws. Statistics show that countries with more restrictive gun laws have significantly fewer incidents of gun-related deaths or injuries. Some advocates for gun control argue that there should be a complete ban on certain types of firearms, such as assault rifles. These very powerful guns have been used in many mass shootings in the past. However, supporters of the Second Amendment argue that citizens have the right to bear arms. They suggest that the Second Amendment grants individuals the right to defend themselves against harm. They also believe that gun ownership is protected by the Constitution and that any attempt to restrict gun ownership is a violation of individual rights. Despite both these arguments, mass shooting incidents continue to occur frequently in the United States. Many people are deeply concerned about the situation and believe that something must be done to prevent these tragedies. Gun control advocates argue that stricter gun laws will help reduce access to firearms for those who intend to use them for violence. In conclusion, the debate over gun control in the United States is far from over. The choice between protecting individual freedoms and preventing gun violence remains a deeply divided issue. Despite this, it is essential to acknowledge that the increasing rate of mass shootings poses an ongoing threat to public safety. Whether or not stricter gun laws will be implemented remains to be seen. However, it is essential to explore all possibilities to protect citizens from the dangers of gun violence."},{"prompt":"As she packed her bags, Maya's heart grew heavy.

This penguin, which lived around 27 million years ago, stood over four feet tall and was about the size of an emperor penguin. The researchers believe that this new species would have been one of the largest penguins ever to have existed. In addition to the new species, the scientists also found fossils of five other previously undiscovered species of penguin during their excavation. The discovery of these six new species is a significant milestone in the study of penguin evolution and could provide valuable insights into how these fascinating creatures have adapted over time. Penguins are thought to have first appeared around 60 million years ago, after the mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs. They are uniquely adapted to their cold and harsh environments, with dense feathers and a layer of blubber that helps them to stay warm in the water. However, despite their fascinating adaptations, relatively little is known about the early evolution of penguins. This new discovery provides an important window into penguin evolution during a critical period in their history. By analyzing the remains of these newly discovered penguins, scientists may be able to better understand how these birds adapted and evolved over millions of years, and how they became one of the most successful and beloved animals on the planet today. The discovery of these new penguin species is an exciting development for both scientists and animal lovers alike.

The Monaco Grand Prix is one of the most iconic and challenging races on the Formula One calendar.

Hamilton started the race in pole position, but he faced a tough challenge from Red Bull’s Max Verstappen. The Dutch driver started in second place and kept Hamilton in his sights throughout the race, putting the pressure on the British driver with a series of fast laps. However, Hamilton held his nerve and managed the gap between himself and Verstappen, eventually crossing the finish line with a lead of just over a second. Hamilton’s Mercedes teammate, Valtteri Bottas, rounded out the podium in third place. Bottas had started the race in third, but lost a place to Verstappen on the first lap.

(CNN) A 27yearold Texas man has been sentenced to 15 months in jail for sending one tweet that constituted a true threat against an FBI agent, the US Department of Justice said Thursday. Justin Carter was arrested in February 2013, months after he had tweeted, Oh yeah, I'm real messed up in the head, I'm going to go shoot up a school full of kids and eat their stillbeating hearts, in a joking argument over the video game League of Legends. His bail was set at 500,000. He was charged with making a terroristic threat and faced up to 10 years in prison. His case sparked debate over freedom of speech, with some arguing that he was being unfairly targeted for making an illadvised comment on Twitter. Carter took a plea deal that saw his sentence capped at 20 years, and with time served and credit for good behavior, he'll be eligible for release in about eight months, said his lawyer. OPTIONS: This is not the first case where someone has been punished for making threats on social media. Justin Carter has issued a formal apology to the FBI agent he threatened in the tweet. The League of Legends community has launched a petition in support of Justin Carter, claiming that the comment was taken out of context. Several media organizations and advocates of free speech have rallied to Carter's defense, claiming that his comment, though irresponsible, did not constitute a genuine threat. The FBI agent who was threatened in Carter's tweet has reported receiving similar threats on a regular basis, and says that this case should serve as a warning to anyone who thinks they can get away with online harassment. The case was thrown out of court after the judge ruled that the tweet was a joke and could not be taken literally. Carter had no prior criminal record and was attending college at the time of his arrest. There is growing concern that the growing use of social media is making it easier for individuals to make terroristic threats online. The use of the term terroristic threat to describe Carter's tweet has been criticized as an example of government overreach. Justin Carter plans to sue the FBI agent he threatened for wrongful prosecution.","completion":"Several media organizations and advocates of free speech have rallied to Carter's defense, claiming that his comment, though irresponsible, did not constitute a genuine threat."},{"prompt":"The Dark Side of Social Media Social media platforms were originally created as a way for people to connect with one another.
