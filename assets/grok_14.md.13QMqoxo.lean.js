If we find ourselves feeling angry, it can be helpful to avoid the situation that is triggering this emotion. This might mean taking a step back or removing ourselves from the situation altogether. Once we have created some distance, we can begin to observe our feelings as we talk to others about what we are experiencing. This can be a useful way to gain some perspective and move towards a more positive resolution. Overall, taking the time to feel, identify and observe our emotions can help us to manage our feelings more effectively. By doing so, we can improve our relationships, reduce stress, and increase our overall well-being."},{"prompt":"A M B I A N C E: Moderately busy, no wait, gargantuan tables, and relatively quick service.

Research in the 1970s on masculinity and femininity found that concepts of masculinity and femininity are more appropriately measured as independent concepts on a separate scale rather than as a single continuum, with each end representing opposite extremes. When compared on the same scale, they act as tradeoffs such, whereby to be more feminine one had to be less masculine and vice versa. However, if they are considered as separate dimensions one can be simultaneously very masculine and very feminine. Similarly, considering heterosexuality and homosexuality on separate scales would allow one to be both very heterosexual and very homosexual or not very much of either.

Not only do they protect our eyes from harmful UV rays, but they also make a fashion statement. However, buying sunglasses can be expensive, especially if you want a unique and customized pair. But did you know that you can make your sunglasses at home? All you need is some plastic, which you can easily find at any crafts store. First, melt some plastic using a heat source, such as a heat gun or an oven. Once the plastic has melted, let it cool for a few minutes until it hardens. Then, mold the plastic into the shape of your desired frames. You can use any mold or shape, depending on your preference and creativity. After molding the frame, it's time to make the earpieces. You can use a hot glue gun to attach the earpieces to the frames or mold them directly onto the frame using melted plastic. It's important to ensure that they fit snugly and comfortably behind your ears. Finally, you need to make the lenses. You can use any clear plastic material for the lenses, such as Lexan or polycarbonate. Cut the material to size and shape using a sharp knife or scissors. Once you have the shape you desire, polish the edges to smooth out any rough bits. With all the pieces ready, it's time to assemble your homemade sunglasses. Attach the lenses to the frame using hot glue or a strong adhesive. And voila! Your customized sunglasses are ready to wear. Making your sunglasses can be a fun and exciting DIY project. It's also an excellent way to save money while creating a unique pair of shades that suit your style. The process of molding and shaping the plastic is entertaining and can also be a bonding activity for family and friends. So why not try making your sunglasses today?

Covering the haphazard endgame of the American civil war via the haphazard actions of a young militia, unformed in mind or manhood, this is an ideal approach. The film turns out to be about the formation of personalities, adulthood and relationships. Lee also shows the beautiful panoramas of the midsouth as a silent character, enduring the strife like a hardy parent. James Schamus' script is probably the standard bearer for this film; close behind it are a number of wellappointed performances that carry it admirably. Jeffrey Wright's name alone could carry this film for me. He's brilliant here but in a slow burning role: instead we are treated to very good (if not revelatory) performances from a large, often recognisable ensemble. A noble, optimistic film.

The 85-year-old man has garnered support from volunteers who rallied to save his home during last year's flooding. The proposed levee is aimed at preventing future flood damage, but Paulson believes that it will have a negative impact on his property value and quality of life. Despite offers from the city, he remains steadfast in his decision to stay put. Last year's flooding posed a serious threat to Paulson's home, but volunteers were quick to respond and assist in rescue efforts. This outpouring of support has given him hope that he will be able to protect his property and way of life, even in the face of opposition from the city. The dispute between Paulson and the city highlights the challenges of balancing public safety with individual property rights. While the levee would certainly be beneficial to the community as a whole, it's important to respect the wishes of those who would be directly impacted by its construction. As the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the city will find a compromise that satisfies both their needs and those of Lloyd Paulson.

Maddy, a mother-of-eight, has also reported that her children have been threatened, adding to the already significant distress she has been experiencing. She candidly expressed how her life has been ruined since the trial's conclusion, which resulted in Zimmerman being acquitted of the murder of Trayvon Martin. As a juror, Maddy is not supposed to discuss the case or reveal details about her deliberations. However, she decided to speak out because she wanted people to know the toll that serving on the jury has taken on her life. She said that she had no idea that her life would be impacted to the extent that it has been and that she has been struggling to make ends meet since losing her job. Maddy's story highlights the difficulties that jurors can face after serving on high-profile cases.

It highlights the need for protection and support for those who choose to speak publicly about their experiences. Maddy's bravery in speaking out must not be ignored, and her story should serve as an eye-opener to the wider public about the potential consequences of serving on a jury."},{"prompt":"Starting in the 1970s, the Bronx often symbolized violence, decay, and urban ruin. The wave of arson in the South Bronx in the 1960s and 1970s inspired the observation that The Bronx is burning: in 1974 it was the title of both a New York Times editorial and a BBC documentary film.

Uranium235 has the distinction of being the only naturally occurring fissile isotope. Uranium238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium239 in a nuclear reactor.

While uranium238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons, uranium235 and to a lesser degree uranium233 have a much higher fission crosssection for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons.

The Church of Alexandria celebrated Easter on the Sunday after the 14th day of the moon (computed using the Metonic cycle) that falls on or after the vernal equinox, which they placed on 21 March. However, the Church of Rome still regarded 25 March as the equinox (until 342) and used a different cycle to compute the day of the moon.

It is not always apparent which single variant represents the author's original work. The process of textual criticism seeks to explain how each variant may have entered the text, either by accident (duplication or omission) or intention (harmonization or censorship), as scribes or supervisors transmitted the original author's text by copying it. The textual critic's task, therefore, is to sort through the variants, eliminating those most likely to be unoriginal, hence establishing a critical text, or critical edition, that is intended to best approximate the original. At the same time, the critical text should document variant readings, so the relation of extant witnesses to the reconstructed original is apparent to a reader of the critical edition. In establishing the critical text, the textual critic considers both external evidence (the age, provenance, and affiliation of each witness) and internal or physical considerations (what the author and scribes, or printers, were likely to have done).

Number of bookmakers has soared by 25% in just five years. Customers drawn to high stake casinostyle gambling machines.","completion":"Don Foster, a British politician, is calling for greater measures to be put in place to prevent unregulated betting shops from opening on UK high streets. The number of bookmakers in the UK has risen by 25% over the past five years, with customers drawn to the high stakes of casino-style gambling machines. Foster is especially concerned about the impact of these machines, which allow players to bet up to £100 (130) every 20 seconds. He argues that not only do they encourage problem gambling, but they also create an unwelcome atmosphere in local communities. Foster is not alone in his concerns. Last year, a cross-party group of MPs called for the maximum stake on these machines to be reduced to just £2 (2.60). This would bring them in line with the maximum bet in traditional betting shops, where customers can only bet up to £100 on a single event. The UK Gambling Commission has also expressed concerns about the rise of these machines. In a report published last year, it called for stricter controls on their use, including a mandatory limit on the speed at which bets can be placed. Despite these concerns, the number of betting shops in the UK continues to grow. This has led to fears that local high streets are becoming overrun with bookmakers, creating an unwelcome environment for residents and visitors alike. Foster's proposals would give local authorities greater control over the number of betting shops that can operate in their area. This would allow them to prevent unregulated bookmakers from setting up shop, and ensure that those that do operate on the high street adhere to strict regulations and standards. While some may argue that this would be overly restrictive, it is clear that action needs to be taken to address the rise of gambling-related harms in the UK. With the number of bookmakers continuing to rise, it is more important than ever that appropriate measures are put in place to protect vulnerable individuals and prevent the spread of unregulated gambling."},{"prompt":"he program uses a database in which indexed file contents are stored.

Triton is the largest Neptunian moon, comprising more than 99.5% of the mass in orbit around Neptune,[e] and it is the only one massive enough to be spheroidal.

Unlike all other large planetary moons in the Solar System, Triton has a retrograde orbit, indicating that it was captured rather than forming in place; it was probably once a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt. It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a synchronous rotation, and it is slowly spiralling inward because of tidal acceleration.

This may seem like a small percentage of the total number of touchdowns scored, but it actually represents a significant portion of red zone possessions. Scoring from close to the goal line is a critical component of any team's offensive game plan. It requires superior execution by the offensive line, the quarterback, and the running backs or receivers. Short yardage situations demand a physical and mental toughness that can make or break a game. Touchdowns from 5 yards or less can come in a variety of ways. One common method is the \\"QB sneak,\\" where the quarterback lines up under center and essentially falls forward to cross the goal line. Another common method is to hand the ball off to a running back who powers his way into the end zone. Additionally, quick passes to a receiver in the flat or in the end zone can also result in touchdowns from short distances. Overall, scoring touchdowns from less than 5 yards out is a testament to a team's ability to execute in critical situations. It requires precision, toughness, and a commitment to excellence on both offense and defense. Fans can expect to see many more touchdowns from close range in the future, as teams continue to perfect their red zone strategies."},{"prompt":"Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? the charm of the first movie is still there , and the story feels like the logical , unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids .

In American football, an onside kick is typically utilized when a team is trailing late in the game and needs to regain possession of the ball quickly. If the kicking team successfully recovers the onside kick, they will retain possession of the ball and have a chance to continue their offensive drive. This can often lead to a game-winning score or a significant momentum swing in their favor. However, if the receiving team successfully recovers the onside kick, they will gain possession of the ball and have an opportunity to score on offense. This can be a devastating blow to the kicking team's chances of winning the game. In some cases, an onside kick may result in the ball going out of bounds or being touched by a member of the kicking team before traveling the required distance, resulting in a penalty and immediate possession for the receiving team. Ultimately, the outcome of an onside kick is unpredictable and can have a significant impact on the outcome of the game. It requires careful planning and execution from the kicking team, while the receiving team must be prepared to defend against the potential strategy."},{"prompt":"Who had a July 1968 UK No.1 with 'Do It Again'?

In this view, phonological representations are sequences of segments made up of distinctive features. These features were an expansion of earlier work by Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle. The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the socalled surface form). An important consequence of the influence SPE had on phonological theory was the downplaying of the syllable and the emphasis on segments.

Clean off any residual dust with a rag or vacuum. Turn the unit on to make sure it’s still running well. Make a note of when you replaced the filter.","completion":"Maintaining your HVAC unit is crucial to ensure optimal performance and maintain indoor air quality. One of the most important maintenance tasks is to replace the air filter regularly. If you have central air, it is essential to locate your HVAC unit and identify the air filter slot. Once you've identified the air filter slot, turn off the unit to avoid any possible injuries while changing the filter. Then, you need to remove the old air filter from the slot carefully. It is essential to check the size of your filter before buying a new one to ensure it fits properly. A new filter should be of the same size and type as the old filter. After you have the correct size of the air filter, insert it carefully into the air filter slot. You should ensure that there are no gaps around the filter once it's in position. Gaps around the filter will allow unfiltered air to enter the HVAC system, which may affect its performance and impact indoor air quality. After inserting the new air filter, it is advisable to clean off any residual dust with a rag or vacuum cleaner. You should remove any debris that has accumulated around the filter. Accumulated debris can also impede the performance of the HVAC system and affect the air quality. Once you've cleaned off any residual dust, turn the unit back on to ensure that it's still running well. If the unit is running well, it's time to make a note of when you replaced the filter. Keeping a record of when you replace the air filter is essential to ensure you replace it at the right time. The frequency of replacing your filter will depend on factors such as the type of filter, its size, and the level of air pollution indoors. In conclusion, if you have central air, it's crucial to maintain your HVAC unit by changing the air filter regularly. To change the filter, locate the air filter slot, turn the unit off, remove the old filter, insert the new filter carefully, clean off any residual dust, turn the unit back on, and make a note of when you replaced the filter.

Procedure involves swapping diseased parts of cells with another egg. The Commons votes on Tuesday on amendments to embryo law.","completion":"Roman Catholic leaders have intensified their campaign against a new law that would permit three-parent babies. The law, which involves swapping out faulty parts of cells with healthy parts from another egg, is known as \\"mitochondrial donation.\\" Members of Parliament are currently being pressured to vote against it. The issue is set to come to a head on Tuesday, when the Commons votes on amendments to the embryo law. The Catholic Church is not the only institution opposed to the mitochondrial donation technique. The Church of England has also criticized it. The strongly worded statements from both groups reflect their belief that the new law constitutes a step too far in the eyes of many religious voices. They say that it could mark a dangerous new phase for reproductive technology, and one that is fraught with ethical peril. At the heart of the debate is the question of when life begins. Some religious leaders argue that it is at conception, while others claim that it is when the baby is born. The main issue with the mitochondrial donation method is that it involves using genetic material from three different parents. Opponents argue that this blurs the line between conception and birth, potentially leading to confusion over the identity of the child and the parents. Despite these concerns, many experts are in favour of the technique. They argue that it could help to prevent the transmission of genetic diseases, such as muscular dystrophy. Supporters note that the procedure only involves a tiny amount of genetic material, and that it could have a huge impact on the health of future generations. They also note that the changes are only made to a small part of the egg, so that the vast majority of the child's genetic material would still come from the mother and father. The debate over mitochondrial donation is likely to continue for some time. Proponents and opponents both have strong arguments, rooted in different ethical and religious traditions. Regardless of the outcome of Tuesday's vote, it is clear that the debate over genetic engineering and reproductive technology is only just beginning."},{"prompt":"Justin breaks down<br>Justin was taking a trip.

This led to a 15-minute tirade of abuse from Pryke, which made teachers concerned for their safety. Despite her behavior, Pryke has since written a letter of apology to staff for her conduct. The mother-of-one was spared jail time by the judge but was warned that she would face imprisonment if such behavior occurred again.

She is also prohibited from coming within 500 yards of Kris Benson and threatening him or their children. The case highlights the dangers of domestic violence and underscores the importance of seeking help if you or someone you know is in an abusive relationship. Domestic violence is a serious issue that affects millions of people every year, and it is essential that victims have access to the resources they need to escape abuse and stay safe. For those who are experiencing domestic violence, there are many organizations that can provide help and support. The National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) is available 24/7 and offers confidential support and resources to victims of domestic violence. Many states also have local domestic violence hotlines that can provide assistance with legal issues, shelter, and other resources. In conclusion, the sentencing of Anna Benson serves as a reminder of the ongoing issue of domestic violence and the need for victims to receive support and assistance. It is important for individuals to speak out against domestic violence and work toward ending this epidemic."},{"prompt":"What is the sentiment of the following review?

Gathering tools can mean the difference between a successful project and a frustrating failure. Before starting, be sure you have the appropriate tools you will need. If you lack a particular tool, consider renting, borrowing, or buying it. Tools to consider include a saw, measuring tape, clamps, drill and drill bits, sandpaper, and safety equipment (eye protection, hearing protection, and gloves).

Altschuler: If Latinos vote for Dems in midterms, GOP may decide to deal on immigration.","completion":"In recent years, the Republican Party has been known for opposing any immigration legislation beyond border control. Daniel Altschuler, a political analyst, points out that the party helped to kill the DREAM Act as part of its strategy to thwart the Democratic agenda. With a growing Latino population, this hard-line position could hurt the GOP in upcoming midterms and beyond. Latinos are keenly aware of the party's position on immigration, and they are not happy about it. For many in this community, passage of the DREAM Act would have provided a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought here as children. The GOP's opposition, therefore, was seen as an affront to the hopes and dreams of millions of people. If the Latino community turns out to vote in large numbers for Democrats in the upcoming midterms, it could force the GOP to reconsider its stance on immigration. As Altschuler points out, the Republican Party is well aware of the changing demographics in this country, and they know they must win over Latino voters if they hope to remain a viable political force. For now, however, the GOP seems content to hold the line on immigration, even if it means alienating a key segment of the electorate. Whether this approach will pay off in the long run remains to be seen.

This resulted in the First Opium War (1839–42). After the war Hong Kong island was ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Nanking and the Chinese market opened to the opium traders of Britain and other nations. The Jardines and Apcar and Company dominated the trade, although P&O also tried to take a share. A Second Opium War fought by Britain and France against China lasted from 1856 until 1860 and led to the Treaty of Tientsin, which legalised the importation of opium. Legalisation stimulated domestic Chinese opium production and increased the importation of opium from Turkey and Persia.

House Speaker John Boehner came out strongly against these groups, stating that they had lost credibility and were misleading their own supporters. Boehner defended the plan, saying it was a step in the right direction and showed that both parties could work together to reach a common goal. The compromise plan also includes new fees for air travel and an increase in employee contributions to pensions for federal workers, among other measures. However, it does not include any significant tax hikes or entitlement reforms, which some argue is necessary to provide a long-term solution to the nation's fiscal problems. Despite these concerns, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle expressed their satisfaction with the deal, calling it a responsible compromise that would help avoid another government shutdown. Members of the Congressional Budget Office also supported the plan, stating that it would reduce the deficit without causing significant harm to the economy. Overall, the approval of the compromise budget plan marks a major step forward for Congress, which has struggled to pass comprehensive fiscal legislation in recent years. It remains to be seen how the Senate will vote, but with the House already on board, the chances of avoiding another government shutdown are looking increasingly positive."},{"prompt":"Article: Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB).

While some sources suggest that the Byzantine fleet was effectively destroyed within a few years of the defeat at Gallipoli, others argue that the decline was more gradual and lasted until the mid-1350s. Regardless of the precise timeline, there is no question that the fall of the Byzantine navy was a tragic loss for the empire. It left Byzantium vulnerable to external threats and contributed to its eventual downfall in the face of Ottoman expansion in the late 14th and early 15th centuries.

Use a HEPA filter. Use your air conditioner. Use exhaust fans. Open windows when using chemicals. Choose your cleaning products carefully. Remove your car from the garage when cranked.","completion":"Improving Ventilation in Your Home: A Comprehensive Guide The air we breathe indoors can be even more polluted than the air outdoors, and with the average person spending up to 90% of their time indoors, it's more important than ever to ensure that the air we're breathing is clean and healthy. Proper ventilation is crucial to achieving this, as it helps to remove harmful pollutants from the air and bring in fresh, clean air from outside. Here are some tips on how to improve ventilation in your home: 1. Use a HEPA filter HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters are some of the most effective filters on the market for removing airborne particles like dust, pollen, and pet dander from the air. They work by trapping these particles in a mesh filter, leaving behind clean, fresh air. There are a variety of HEPA filters available, including portable units that can be placed in individual rooms, and larger, whole-house units that can be installed in your HVAC system. 2. Use your air conditioner Your air conditioner not only helps to cool your home, but it can also help to improve ventilation by circulating air throughout your home. Make sure to keep your air filters clean and replace them regularly to ensure that your air conditioner is working at its most efficient. 3. Use exhaust fans Exhaust fans in your kitchen and bathroom can help to remove moisture and odors from your home, which can help to prevent the growth of mold and mildew. Make sure to use these fans as often as possible, especially when cooking or taking a shower. 4. Open windows when using chemicals Many household cleaners and products contain harmful chemicals that can pollute the air in your home. When using these products, make sure to open windows and use fans to help ventilate the area and reduce your exposure to these chemicals. 5. Choose your cleaning products carefully To avoid exposure to harmful chemicals in the first place, consider choosing cleaning products that are labeled as \\"green\\" or \\"natural.\\" These products are typically made with non-toxic ingredients and are less likely to pollute the air in your home. 6. Remove your car from the garage when cranked If you have an attached garage, make sure to remove your car from the garage when cranked. The exhaust fumes from your car can quickly pollute the air in your garage and make their way into your home. Instead, try parking your car outside or in a carport to reduce your exposure to these pollutants. Improving ventilation in your home is an important step towards creating a healthier indoor environment. By following these tips, you can help to reduce the amount of harmful pollutants in the air and enjoy cleaner, fresher air in your home."},{"prompt":"Food and margaritas are really good.

An earthquake with a 6.7 magnitude is capable of causing significant damage, especially in areas of poor construction. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. A staff member at Iraklion Airport told CNN they didn't feel the earthquake. Similar reports came from staff members at hotels just outside Iraklion and in western Crete.

Abu Qatada gained notoriety in the early 2000s for his extremist views and support of jihadist groups. His sermons were found in an apartment used by some of the individuals involved in the 9/11 attacks. This discovery solidified his reputation as a dangerous and influential figure in the world of Islamist terrorism.

His case has raised questions about the effectiveness of the UK's deportation system when dealing with individuals who are considered a threat to national security. The trial against Abu Qatada is ongoing, and it remains to be seen what the outcome will be. However, his past convictions and reputation as a radical preacher mean that he will continue to be closely monitored by UK authorities, regardless of the outcome of his trial.

Previously, Spanish Kings (at least from 1471) issued a largely copper fractional coinage called blancas, with a nominal moneyofaccount value of 0.5 maravedí, but with a very small amount of silver to convince the public that it was indeed preciousmetal money. The blanca issued in 1471 had a silver fineness of 10 grains or 3.47% (weighing 1.107g).

By the start of the 17th century, inflation took hold of Spain as the gap between nominal and silverbased prices dramatically shifted. The purely copper coinage had done its damage to Spain.

Embroider","completion":"Choosing the right thread when embroidering is crucial for your final product. The thread you select should either complement or match the fabric that you're working with. This decision has a big impact on the finished product both in terms of appearance and durability. When choosing the thread, make sure to take into account the color of the material, which will help you decide what color thread to use. For example, if you’re working on a lighter fabric, choose a lighter thread for the embroidery work. Similarly, if the fabric is darker, a darker thread would be more suitable. In terms of complementing the fabric, it’s important to consider the texture of the material. If the fabric has a rough texture, go for a thread with a similar texture, so the embroidery work blends in better. On the other hand, if the texture of the fabric is smooth, the embroidery can be more vibrant, with a shiny or smooth thread. Picking a matching thread is vital because it ensures that the embroidery will not stand out and make the garment or item look unprofessional. But it is also important to select a durable thread. Consider the purpose of the garment or item and how it may be washed or used. A thread that should endure heavy use will require something sturdy, like a polyester thread. In conclusion, choosing the correct embroidery thread is important to give the finished piece a polished look. To summarize the main considerations you can follow this tips: choose a thread color that matches or complements the fabric color; use thread with similar texture to the fabric; and make sure to choose a thread that will withstand its intended use.

Having a variety of guards to choose from can make it much easier to achieve a specific look, whether you are going for a clean-shaven appearance or a more rugged style. Another important consideration when choosing a trimmer is the location where you plan to groom. Ideally, you should choose a location that is both convenient and private.

This means you’ll need to reduce any other liquids used in the recipe to account for the dairy.

This will ensure that the final dish isn’t too watery or thin. Reducing other liquids in a recipe can be a bit tricky because you don’t want to change the flavor or consistency of the dish. One way to do this is to gradually add the dairy to the recipe and then adjust the other liquids as needed. This will allow you to gauge the texture and flavor of the dish as you go. Another option is to simply reduce the amount of other liquids used in the recipe by a certain percentage, based on the amount of dairy being added. This is a good method to use when you’re making a recipe that’s been tried and tested, and just needs a bit of tweaking to account for the dairy.

The animal rights group claims this is evidence of severe animal cruelty and have demanded that Koch Foods be held accountable for these actions. Koch Foods has since responded, claiming that the video is \\"inaccurate and out of context.\\" While the company admits that there is room for improvement in their processes, they insist that they take animal welfare seriously and comply with all regulations.

She felt ill, and her condition worsened rapidly. Initially, she thought she had picked up an illness while traveling. She underwent a battery of tests and struggled to find any help. It was only when doctors discovered that her stomach muscles were paralysed that they were able to diagnose Gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is a debilitating condition that paralyses the stomach muscles, making it difficult for food to pass through the digestive system. Ayllah-Beau Foley tried various treatments but to no avail. Her stomach's inability to function has forced her to be fed through a tube in a vein in her neck. Gastroparesis can strike anyone, and the cause remains largely unknown. While it is not a common condition, it can occur as a side effect of diseases such as cancer, or as a complication of surgery or medication. As in Ayllah-Beau Foley's case, the underlying cause may remain unknown. People living with Gastroparesis need ongoing support to manage their symptoms. With no cure at present, management is aimed at reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. If you suspect that you have Gastroparesis, it is essential to seek medical help immediately, as early diagnosis may slow the progression of the disease."},{"prompt":"What is the sentiment of the following review?

James Steart leads an all star cast in the scenic Northwest, which is filmed in great splendor. The scenery and costumes are great. There is action and adventure. Stewart plays a wealthy cattleman who runs afoul of a crooked government in the old Nothwest. The main drawback is the stereotypical cynic that Hollywood has always made into a hero. Even when this movie was made, the cynic was the stereotypical hero, and the one Stewart portrays really has few saving graces. He is kind to his two partners, and that does give him an extra dimension of credibility and likability. However, he is so piggish to everyone else, it is hard to really care for him, or to accept him. He is much like the one dimensional spaghetti Western characters (cut not that bad). Still, the minor characters are quite enjoyable. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan, and others make this worth watching. OPTIONS: negative positive","completion":"Mixed/Neutral.

These men were organised into 21 cavalry regiments and 75 infantry battalions, with about 280 modern artillery pieces, organised into 70 batteries, in support. In addition to this, however, in a boost to the army's strength, the Afghan command could call upon the loyalty of up to 80,000 frontier tribesmen and an indeterminate number of deserters from local militia units under British command. In reality, the Afghan regular army was not ready for war. As in past years, the upper levels of the officer corps were riddled with political intrigue.

I love this type of hole in the wall Chinese food spot. At first I was skeptic because of the location which is hidden in a strip mall but the food and service spoke for itself. We ordered the pecking duck and the spicy egg plant. The pecking duck took a few min to prepare so the waitress offered us a bowl of hot and sour soup while we wait. The duck was prepared table side with the crispy skin served with the steamed buns, green onion, and hoisen sauce.
