The threat against Khiva can be traced back to the 19th century when the Russian Empire began its expansion into Central Asia. Khiva, a small khanate located in present-day Uzbekistan, was one of the last remaining independent states in the region. In the late 1800s, Russia began to put pressure on Khiva to accept Russian suzerainty. When Khiva refused, Russia launched a military campaign against the khanate in 1873, ultimately annexing it in 1876. The Basmachi movement, on the other hand, emerged in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917. The movement was made up of Central Asian rebels who opposed the Bolsheviks' attempts to impose their authority on the region. The Basmachi engaged in guerrilla warfare against the Bolsheviks throughout the 1920s, but were eventually suppressed by Soviet forces in the 1930s. Therefore, it is clear that the threat against Khiva occurred before the emergence of the Basmachi movement.

Whether you are preparing a dessert or creating a craft project, this process can help you achieve your desired results. For those who are unfamiliar with wafer cones, they are a popular dessert ingredient that is commonly used in ice cream cones. These cones are made from a crispy wafer material and are shaped like a cone. However, the base of the cone can be quite thick, which can make them difficult to work with. To cut the base from each wafer cone, you will need a sharp knife or scissors. Carefully hold the cone in one hand and use the blade of the knife or scissors to cut around the base of the cone. Be sure to apply enough pressure to cut through the thick wafer material, but be careful not to cut through the entire cone. Once the base has been removed, you will be left with a cone that is easier to work with. This is particularly helpful when you are assembling a dessert, as it allows you to place the cone upright without it tipping over. It also makes the cone easier to fill with ice cream or other ingredients, as there is no longer a thick layer of wafer material getting in the way. Cutting the base from each wafer cone can also be useful when creating craft projects. For example, if you are making a Christmas tree decoration out of wafer cones, removing the base can help you to stack the cones easily and create a more stable structure. It can also make it easier to glue the cones together without any bumps or uneven surfaces. In conclusion, cutting the base from each wafer cone can be a helpful technique for a variety of situations. Whether you are creating a dessert or a craft project, this process can help you to achieve your desired results with greater ease and precision.

However, Price repeatedly overpaid herself and ended up stealing a total of ¬£16,470. Price admitted to taking the money from the company owned by her sister Kenis and brother-in-law Gareth Thomas 'because it was so easy'. This act of embezzlement and betrayal had serious consequences for Price. Today, she was sentenced to eight months in jail at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court. This case highlights the dangers of nepotism in business. Price abused her position of trust and authority in her family's electrical firm in order to enrich herself at the company's expense. Her repeated overpayments are a clear indication of her disregard for the company's financial wellbeing and an absence of ethical considerations. This kind of behaviour must be condemned and punished. Embezzlement not only erodes trust among colleagues and employees but also has serious legal implications. Price's jail sentence can serve as a warning to others about the severity of such financial crimes. In conclusion, Deborah Price's actions are a sobering reminder that financial misconduct can happen in any organisation, including those run by family members. It's essential that businesses and companies have adequate checks and balances in place to prevent embezzlement by insiders.

Aspiritech aims to help harness these strengths while minimizing the challenges associated with the neurodevelopmental disorder. The organization's primary goal is to provide employment opportunities to individuals with Asperger's in the field of software testing. Software quality assurance demands a keen eye for detail and gives preference to individuals who can methodically and rigorously test software without getting fatigued. Aspiritech has found an ideal partnership between the needs of software companies and the strengths of people with Asperger's Syndrome. Aspiritech operates as a social enterprise and has created an atmosphere of inclusivity, where people with Asperger's feel accepted, valued, and respected. The results have been impressive; employees with Asperger's have proven themselves to be exceptional in a field where attention to detail is essential. They have demonstrated outstanding results, with fewer errors and faster testing times than non-Asperger's employees. The success of Aspiritech has not gone unnoticed.

They provide much-needed employment opportunities that cater to the unique skills of people with Asperger's, who often find it challenging to find work.

Corticosteroid creams block certain inflammatory and itchinducing chemicals in the immune system, and can be applied directly to itchy skin. Antihistamines are primarily used when itchiness is a result of an allergic reaction.

If your itchiness is the result of a fungal infection such as ringworm or athlete‚Äôs foot, your doctor may prescribe an antifungal agent.

Ask your doctor about medications for itching caused by nerve damage.","completion":"If you are experiencing skin conditions such as psoriasis, ringworm, head lice or itching caused by nerve damage, then it is essential to consult a dermatologist for proper diagnosis and treatment. Psoriasis is a common skin disorder that causes skin cells to build up and form scales and dry patches. If you suspect that you have psoriasis, it is imperative to see a dermatologist for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Ringworm is a contagious fungal infection that can cause a red, circular rash on the skin. This condition can be treated with oral medication and medicated shampoo to manage the symptoms. Head lice are tiny insects that can cause itching and discomfort. These can be eliminated by using an insecticidal shampoo that is specifically designed to kill head lice and their eggs. Itching caused by nerve damage can be managed with medications prescribed by a doctor. It is critical to ask a healthcare professional about these medications to avoid any complications or side effects. In conclusion, seeking medical help and proper treatment for any skin condition is vital for maintaining healthy skin.

Copper is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver bound to albumin. After processing in the liver, copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase. Copper transport here involves the protein ceruloplasmin, which carries the majority of copper in blood. Ceruloplasmin also carries copper that is excreted in milk, and is particularly wellabsorbed as a copper source. Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation (about 5 mg a day, vs. about 1 mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via bile, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.

Flights to and from the city were delayed as visibility was reduced to just 150 metres. Experts say that a slow moving weather pattern with a high pressure ridge over Victoria and light winds had caused this week's foggy conditions, and it might persist for a few more days. Passengers traveling to Melbourne are advised to check with their airlines before departing to avoid inconvenience. Fog is a natural meteorological phenomenon that occurs when air near the ground cools down, and its moisture condenses, resulting in a blanket of damp air, reducing visibility in the area. It's a common problem in many cities around the world, especially in winter, sometimes causing major disruptions to air traffic, traffic on roads, and shipping. Experts suggest taking precautionary measures when driving or walking in foggy conditions to prevent accidents, such as using headlights, staying visible, and driving slowly. In extreme cases, avoid traveling until visibility improves. Fog is a temporary problem, and it often disappears after sunrise when the sun's rays warm up the air and evaporate the moisture. Till then, residents, businesses, and tourist visiting Melbourne are advised to take necessary precautions to stay safe and avoid unnecessary delays. In conclusion, the foggy conditions in Melbourne caused by a slow-moving weather pattern are a temporary problem, and it is likely to disappear in a few days. However, it's essential to take precautions to stay safe until the conditions improve. Passengers traveling to and from Melbourne should stay updated, check with their airlines or transport providers, and plan accordingly to avoid inconvenience."},{"prompt":"Produce a detailed sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = The Twenty Two, food = French, area = riverside, familyFriendly = ye","completion":"The Twenty Two is a French restaurant located in a charming riverside area, and it is perfectly suitable for families with a family-friendly atmosphere."},{"prompt":"The entire plan hung on their ability to keep their numbers unknown.

The policy of dragonnades was highly effective in achieving its objective, as many Huguenots eventually gave in to the pressures and converted, under duress, to Catholicism. The Edict of Fontainebleau, on the other hand, was issued in 1685 by King Louis XIV, and it revoked the Edict of Nantes, which had granted religious tolerance and freedom to French Protestants since 1598. The Edict of Fontainebleau, therefore, represented a dramatic reversal of the state's policy towards the Huguenots. The Edict of Fontainebleau ordered the destruction of Huguenot churches and the closure of their schools, and it prohibited Huguenots from practicing their religion and emigrating from France. The Edict declared that there could be only one religion in France, and that was Catholicism. In conclusion, while the policy of dragonnades and the Edict of Fontainebleau were both aimed at suppressing Protestantism in France, the policy of dragonnades was implemented before the Edict of Fontainebleau. The policy of dragonnades paved the way for the more extreme measures of the Edict of Fontainebleau, which marked the end of a long period of relative religious freedom in France."},{"prompt":"What is the title of this article: The first geographical entity that was called Armenia by neighboring peoples (such as by Hecataeus of Miletus and on the Achaemenid Behistun Inscription) was established in the late 6th century BC under the Orontid dynasty within the Achaemenid Persian Empire as part of the latters' territories, and which later became a kingdom.

If you want to get the color you want, the first step is to know where to find it. Paint stores, home improvement stores, and online retailers all offer a wide selection of colors, so do some research and find the ones that offer the specific shade you're looking for. In addition to knowing where to get the color you want, you should also have a clear idea of the look you are trying to achieve. Do you want a bold, dramatic statement or a more subdued, calming atmosphere? This will help you narrow down your options and choose the right color palette for your space. While many people opt for traditional paint options, like flat, semi-gloss, and high-gloss finishes, there are also less common options to consider. For example, chalk paint provides a matte finish and can give a vintage, shabby chic look to furniture and decor. Metallic paint adds a modern, industrial touch to surfaces like accent walls and furniture. Finally, when considering layering techniques, it's important to understand the pros and cons of each. Glazing, for example, involves applying a thin layer of paint over a base color to create a translucent effect. This can add depth and texture to walls but may require more time and effort. Brushing and rolling are more traditional techniques that offer a smooth, even finish but may not have the same depth of texture. By knowing where to find the colors you want, considering the look you want to achieve, exploring less traditional paint options, and understanding layering techniques, you can create a beautiful and personalized space that reflects your style and personality."},{"prompt":"up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched How would the sentiment of this sentence be perceived?

This reflects the growing trend of wealthy individuals from emerging markets looking to invest in developed economies like the UK. While some have criticized the visa program for providing a fast track to residency for the wealthy, supporters argue that it brings significant economic benefits to the country. By incentivizing foreign investment, the UK can create jobs, boost local economies, and enhance its overall competitiveness on the global stage. As Brexit negotiations continue, the UK will likely be looking for new ways to attract investment and maintain its position as a leading financial center. The tier 1 investor visa program offers an important avenue for achieving these goals, and it is likely that demand from wealthy foreigners will continue to surge in the years ahead."},{"prompt":"Matt, Attached is the PSA Form.

Remember you were born with it. Get out of your head.","completion":"Recognizing one's talents and good qualities is an essential step towards building self-confidence. However, this is easier said than done. Many people struggle to identify their strengths and tend to focus on their weaknesses. If this is the case, take some time to reflect on your accomplishments, experiences, and skills. What do you enjoy doing? What have you accomplished in the past that you are proud of? Asking these questions will help you to recognize your talents and good qualities. Once you have identified your talents and good qualities, write them down. This exercise not only reinforces your self-awareness, but it helps you to visualize your strengths. Reading this list regularly can also help to boost your confidence. However, obstacles can block your confidence, and it's essential to recognize what they are. Fear of failure, fear of rejection, and negative self-talk are common obstacles. Once you have identified them, think of ways to overcome them. This could involve seeking support from a therapist, coach, or friend. Remember, you're not alone. Everyone struggles with confidence at some point in their lives. It's important to see confidence as a process, not a singular achievement. Building self-confidence takes time and effort, and it's not something that can be achieved overnight. Celebrate your small victories along the way, and remember that every step counts. It's also crucial to remember that you were born with confidence. As children, we are unabashedly confident and sure of ourselves. It's only over time that we develop self-doubt and lose some of that confidence. Reconnecting with that innate sense of confidence can be a helpful reminder that you have it within you. Finally, get out of your head. Sometimes, we overthink and become paralyzed by our thoughts. Try to focus on the present moment and take action towards your goals. This may involve stepping out of your comfort zone and taking risks. However, the more you do this, the more confident you will become. In conclusion, recognizing your talents and good qualities, identifying obstacles to your confidence, viewing confidence as a process, remembering that you were born with confidence, and getting out of your head are all essential steps towards building self-confidence.

It might be your city, town, or neighborhood. Your habitat can be altered. Most people move a few times in their lives. But a plant cannot move. An animal may not be suited to live in another area.

Extinction is when a species disappears forever. Once a species is extinct, it can never be brought back. Humans cause habitat destruction in many ways. There are two common ways this happens. Land may be cleared. Another way is when an animal or plant is brought to an area where it does not belong. Question: How do people's habitats differ from a plant's?

OPTIONS: Yes It's impossible to say No","completion":"No."},{"prompt":"Write an article that answers the following question: How many yards was the shortest touchdown?","completion":"The length of the shortest touchdown can vary depending on the league and division of the football game being played. In the National Football League (NFL), the shortest touchdown possible is one yard. This is because the touchdown zone, also known as the end zone, begins at the goal line, which is one yard away from the end of the playing field. Therefore, any play that results in the ball crossing the goal line within the end zone counts as a touchdown. It's important to note that touchdowns can also be scored from further distances. In fact, the longest touchdown in NFL history was 109 yards and was scored by Antonio Cromartie of the San Diego Chargers in 2007. However, regardless of how far away the ball is from the end zone when the touchdown is scored, it will always count as six points. In other football leagues or divisions, the length of the shortest touchdown may differ. For example, college football typically requires players to cross the goal line with two feet down, which may result in shorter touchdowns. High school football may also have different requirements for touchdowns. In summary, the length of the shortest touchdown depends on the rules and regulations of the league or division in which the football game is being played. In the NFL, the shortest touchdown is one yard, but in other leagues or divisions, it may vary."},{"prompt":"Triple: Cocum eatType pub; Cocum priceRange ¬£2025; Cocum customer rating 3 out of 5; Cocum familyFriendly no What is a sentence that describes this triple?","completion":"The triple represents a pub called Cocum, which serves food and has a price range of ¬£20-25.

One reason for the disparity is whites tend to make more money than blacks and Hispanics, which makes qualifying for a loan much easier. Prices in black and Hispanic neighborhoods grew faster during the economic boom, but fell even harder when the housing bubble burst. The difference in home ownership between black and white households is the same now as it was in 1900.","completion":"A recent study suggests that there is a significant difference between the mortgage refusal rates for different ethnic groups in the United States. One of the main reasons for this disparity is that white households tend to earn more money than their black and Hispanic counterparts, making it easier for them to qualify for loans. Interestingly, the research also shows that during the economic boom of the early 2000s, home prices in black and Hispanic neighborhoods grew at a faster rate than those in predominantly white areas. However, when the housing bubble burst, these same neighborhoods experienced a more severe decline in home values than white communities. As a result, the gap between black and white home ownership rates remains unchanged since the turn of the 20th century. Even though many people believe that discrimination in the housing market has improved significantly since then, this study suggests that there is still much work to be done to ensure that all Americans have equal access to the benefits of home ownership. Ultimately, it is clear that there are many factors at play when it comes to mortgage refusal rates and home ownership disparities in the United States. However, this study provides valuable insights into the challenges that many minority households face when trying to secure a loan and purchase a home. Only by recognizing and addressing these issues can we truly create a fair and just housing market for all Americans."},{"prompt":"What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation?

First, you will need to cut a length of bead string that is twelve beads long. You will also need to cut a second piece of bead string that is just two beads long.

However, if we narrow the scope to military tactics, we can explore how tactics have evolved over time and who has played a significant role in this evolution. Military tactics have been around since humans began engaging in organized warfare. Ancient civilizations like the Greeks and Romans developed tactics such as the phalanx formation and the testudo, respectively. These tactics were effective in their time, but as technology advanced, new tactics had to be developed. During the Middle Ages, the use of cavalry and archers became prevalent, and formations like the shield wall were used. The advent of gunpowder and firearms in the 15th and 16th centuries led to the development of new tactics such as the reliance on muskets for infantry and the use of artillery. In more recent times, World War I saw the use of trench warfare and the development of new tactics like the creeping barrage. World War II saw the use of more mobile tactics such as blitzkrieg and the use of airborne troops. In modern times, technology has played a significant role in the evolution of tactics. The use of drones and other unmanned vehicles has changed how reconnaissance and surveillance are conducted. The development of precision-guided munitions has made warfare much more accurate and reduced collateral damage. So, who has played a significant role in the evolution of tactics? The answer is not as simple as pointing to one person or group. It has taken the collective efforts of military leaders, strategists, and even scientists and engineers to develop new tactics throughout history. One thing is certain: the evolution of tactics will continue as technology continues to advance and new challenges arise."},{"prompt":"Triple: The Rice Boat eatType restaurant; The Rice Boat food Italian; The Rice Boat customer rating 3 out of 5; The Rice Boat area riverside; The Rice Boat familyFriendly yes What is a sentence that describes this triple?","completion":"The Rice Boat is an Italian restaurant located in the riverside area, with a customer rating of 3 out of 5 and is family-friendly."},{"prompt":"Article: The cellular phone carrier group Open Mobile Terminal Platform (OMTP) in 2007 endorsed microUSB as the standard connector for data and power on mobile devices In addition, on 22 October 2009 the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has also announced that it had embraced microUSB as the Universal Charging Solution its energyefficient onechargerfitsall new mobile phone solution, and added: Based on the MicroUSB interface, UCS chargers also include a 4star or higher efficiency rating‚Äî‚Äã‚Äãup to three times more energyefficient than an unrated charger.

Without additional information, such as the teams playing, the specific game and the time frame during which the two touchdowns were scored, it is impossible to determine the exact number of yards from which they were made. However, to provide some context, touchdowns in American football are earned by carrying or throwing the ball into the opponent's end zone. The distance from which a touchdown is scored varies depending on how far the team has advanced down the field prior to the score. In American football, each team has 4 downs or chances to advance the ball at least 10 yards. If successful, they reset the downs and can advance another 10 yards. When a team fails to advance 10 yards in 4 downs, they turn over the ball to the other team at the spot where the last play ended. It is reasonable to assume that the two touchdowns referenced were likely scored from within the red zone, a term used to describe the area on the field between the 20-yard line and the end zone. However, even within the red zone, the number of yards from which a touchdown is scored can vary widely. In conclusion, without additional context, it is impossible to accurately answer the question of \\"Two touchdowns were made from how many yards out?\\" However, by providing some basic information about American football and the red zone, we can infer that the answer is likely to vary based on the specific circumstances of the game."},{"prompt":"Premise: Before graduating from Loyola Law School in 1993, Zucker interviewed with a prestigious Santa Monica law firm and deftly matched wits with the partners over lunch at an upscale restaurant.

Another theory is trade. The expansion of trade among West Asia, India and Southeast Asia helped the spread of the religion as Muslim traders from Southern Yemen (Hadramout) brought Islam to the region with their large volume of trade. Many settled in Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. This is evident in the ArabIndonesian, ArabSingaporean, and ArabMalay populations who were at one time very prominent in each of their countries. The second theory is the role of missionaries or Sufis.[citation needed] The Sufi missionaries played a significant role in spreading the faith by introducing Islamic ideas to the region.

The creature is an ancestor of chelicerates, a group of arthropods that includes spiders, scorpions, and their kin. This fossil shows the moment when chelicerates branched off from other arthropods, including crustaceans and insects. The discovery was made by Professor Strausfeld of the University of Arizona. According to him, the ancestors of spiders and their kin lived side by side with the ancestors of crustaceans. This close proximity likely led to the divergence of these two groups. Chelicerates are characterized by their two-part body and lack of antennae. This sets them apart from other arthropods, like crustaceans and insects. The newly discovered ancestor had chelicerate-like traits, like a segmented body and a specialized mouthpart for capturing prey. This discovery is important because it helps us understand the early evolution of arthropods. Chelicerates are one of the most diverse groups of animals on the planet, so understanding their origins is key to understanding the diversity of life as a whole. In conclusion, the discovery of a chelicerate ancestor in China provides valuable insight into the evolution of spiders and scorpions. By studying these ancient creatures, we can learn more about the origins of one of the most diverse groups of animals on Earth."},{"prompt":"Find the right ending to this passage.

Additionally, drivers can now chime every two minutes while driving, rather than the previous three-minute limit. These changes come despite opposition from the Noise Abatement Society. The new rules were implemented by the Department for Transport in an effort to modernize the regulations and reflect the changing habits of drivers. The previous limits were considered outdated and did not reflect the prevalence of modern technology in vehicles. While many drivers may welcome the longer time limit for music and increased chime intervals, the changes have been met with opposition from groups such as the Noise Abatement Society. These groups argue that the increased noise levels could cause issues for residents near busy roads or highways. Despite the opposition, the Department for Transport maintains that the changes will not significantly impact noise levels and that they have taken steps to mitigate any potential negative effects. The department recommends that drivers use discretion when playing music or using their horn, especially in residential areas or at night. The changes have also been met with criticism from some who argue that the government should focus on more pressing issues, such as road safety or emissions reduction. However, the Department for Transport defends the changes as a step towards modernization and updating outdated regulations.
