Though the Hanoverians defeated an army of 60,000 French at Minden, Austrian general Daun forced the surrender of an entire Prussian corps of 13,000 in the Battle of Maxen.

Some entomologists suggest that the wings are from paranotal lobes, or extensions from the insect's exoskeleton called the nota, called the paranotal theory. Other theories are based on a pleural origin. These theories include suggestions that wings originated from modified gills, spiracular flaps or as from an appendage of the epicoxa. The epicoxal theory suggests the insect wings are modified epicoxal exites, a modified appendage at the base of the legs or coxa. In the Carboniferous age, some of the Meganeura dragonflies had as much as a 50 cm (20 in) wide wingspan. The appearance of gigantic insects has been found to be consistent with high atmospheric oxygen. The respiratory system of insects constrains their size, however the high oxygen in the atmosphere allowed larger sizes.

It's also important to reduce caffeine and alcohol, which can worsen symptoms of depression. Instead, focus on eating more foods that can reduce depression.

However, it is important to make smart choices when it comes to what we consume as it can have a significant impact on our overall wellbeing. Here are some guidelines you can follow to ensure you are making healthy choices: Firstly, have a good snack. Snacks are a great way to keep you fueled throughout the day. However, it is important to choose healthy options such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. These foods are low in calories, packed with nutrients, and will help you maintain your energy levels. Secondly, drink plenty of water. Water is essential for our bodies as it helps regulate body temperature, keeps our joints lubricated, and helps flush out toxins. It is recommended to drink at least 8-10 glasses of water a day to keep our bodies hydrated and healthy. Thirdly, don’t overuse caffeine. Caffeine can provide a quick energy boost, but it is important not to overdo it. Too much caffeine can lead to anxiety, sleep problems, and digestive issues. It is recommended to limit caffeine intake to no more than 400mg per day, which is equivalent to about four cups of coffee. Lastly, avoid alcoholic drinks. While alcohol can be a social lubricant, it is important to consume it in moderation. Drinking too much alcohol can lead to dehydration, liver damage, and other health problems. It is recommended for men to have no more than 2 drinks per day, and for women to have no more than 1 drink per day. In conclusion, making healthy food and drink choices is important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that you are fueling your body with the nutrients it needs to thrive.

One tip that can help improve your rice is to let it soak for 10 to 15 minutes prior to cooking. To start, place your desired amount of rice in a colander. Make sure to rinse the rice thoroughly with water until the water runs clear. This will help remove any excess starch, dirt or debris that can make your rice sticky. Once you’ve rinsed the rice, let it soak in the water for 10 to 15 minutes. This soaking process will help the rice absorb the water and cook more evenly. Additionally, soaking rice can help remove any remaining impurities, which can promote better digestion. After 10 to 15 minutes, drain the water from the colander and transfer the rice to a pot or rice cooker. Add the appropriate amount of water based on the kind of rice you are cooking, usually a 1:2 rice to water ratio. Bring the rice to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and let it cook for the appropriate amount of time based on the type of rice (e.g. white rice takes around 18 minutes). By soaking your rice prior to cooking, you’ll find that your finished product is more fluffy and evenly cooked.

Included not acknowledging mistakes in care and inadequate apologies being offered. GPs also under fire for striking off patients.","completion":"The Health Service Ombudsman has revealed that it received a startling 150,859 complaints between 2011 and 2012. A significant number of these complaints were related to issues such as not acknowledging mistakes in care and inadequate apologies being offered. In addition, GPs have also been under fire for striking off patients. The number of complaints received by the Health Service Ombudsman is troubling, as it highlights the number of patients who are dissatisfied with the care they have received. It is important for healthcare providers to acknowledge their mistakes and take responsibility for them when they occur. Failing to do so can erode patient trust and ultimately undermine the effectiveness of the entire healthcare system. One of the issues highlighted by the complaints is the lack of adequate apologies being offered. When mistakes occur, patients have a right to expect a sincere and meaningful apology. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. In some instances, apologies are not offered at all, while in others they are insincere and lacking in empathy. This can add insult to injury and exacerbate the patient's anguish. Another area of concern is the striking off of patients by GPs. While there may be valid reasons for doing so, such as when a patient repeatedly misses appointments, it is essential that procedures are followed correctly and that patients are treated fairly. Patients who are arbitrarily struck off by a GP may have a legitimate complaint, and this is reflected in the number of complaints received by the Health Service Ombudsman. It is important for healthcare providers to take patient complaints seriously and to address them promptly and appropriately. When complaints are ignored or inadequately handled, they can escalate and lead to broader issues of patient mistrust and dissatisfaction. Recognizing this, healthcare providers should prioritize the proper handling of complaints as a means of improving patient satisfaction and ensuring the long-term success and effectiveness of the healthcare system."},{"prompt":"dentify the most salient words in this sentence: wagon being pulled by mule in village during a road trip km e","completion":"wagon, mule, village, road trip, east"},{"prompt":"The eight books and four cartoons are available for iPad iPhone and iPod Touch Add punctuatio","completion":"\\"The eight books and four cartoons are available for iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch.\\""},{"prompt":"it possible to conclude that Big brown and white spotted dog laying on a jacket on the street. if A dog is relaxing on a busy street after chasing a cat.?

Its original name Honovere may mean high (river)bank, though this is debated (cf. das Hohe Ufer). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century due to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult, its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine, and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and northwest of the Harz mountains, so that eastwest traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia.

Each chemical bond in a molecule vibrates at a frequency characteristic of that bond. A group of atoms in a molecule (e.g., CH2) may have multiple modes of oscillation caused by the stretching and bending motions of the group as a whole. If an oscillation leads to a change in dipole in the molecule then it will absorb a photon that has the same frequency. The vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of infrared light. Typically, the technique is used to study organic compounds using light radiation from 4000–400 cm−1, the midinfrared. A spectrum of all the frequencies of absorption in a sample is recorded. This can be used to gain information about the sample composition in terms of chemical groups present and also its purity (for example, a wet sample will show a broad OH absorption around 3200 cm−1).

The Toungoo-Arakan conflict began in 1531 when Toungoo's king, Tabinshwehti, launched a campaign to annex Arakan. The Arakanese, led by King Min Bin, fiercely resisted the invasion and were able to push back the Toungoo forces. However, Toungoo did not give up and continued to launch attacks on Arakan throughout the 1530s and 1540s. In 1554, Bayinnaung, who became king of Toungoo that same year, resumed the conquest of Arakan. Like his predecessor, Bayinnaung encountered stiff resistance from the Arakanese army. Nevertheless, he was able to capture the Arakanese capital of Mrauk-U in 1556, putting an end to Arakan's independence. Despite the conquest, Arakan continued to resist Toungoo rule. In 1599, a group of Arakanese rebels, with the help of Portuguese mercenaries, launched a successful insurrection against Toungoo. They were able to regain control of Mrauk-U and establish an independent state that lasted until the Burmese conquest of Arakan in 1784. In short, the Toungoo dynasty attempted to conquer Arakan for over two decades, starting in the early 1530s and ending in 1556 with the capture of Mrauk-U."},{"prompt":"Does Foxconn, Apple's manufacturer, initially denied the abuses, but when an auditing team from Apple found that workers had been working longer hours than were allowed under Chinese law, they promised to prevent workers working more hours than the code allowed. contain the correct answer to What auditor company did Apple hire to oversee worker conditions following the controversy?

To reduce your risk of getting bitten by mosquitoes, there are a few simple steps you can take. Firstly, wear loose-fitting clothing. Tight clothing can make it easier for mosquitoes to bite through your clothes. Loose clothing, such as long-sleeved shirts and pants, will provide a barrier between the mosquitoes and your skin. Secondly, choose long clothing. Mosquitoes are attracted to heat, which means they are more likely to bite exposed skin. Wearing clothing that covers your arms and legs can help reduce the number of bites. Thirdly, use netting to protect your face and neck. Mosquitoes are more likely to target your face and neck, as these areas are often exposed. Using a mosquito net around your bed or when outdoors can help keep mosquitoes away from your face. Finally, consider permethrin-treated clothing. Permethrin is a synthetic insecticide that repels and kills mosquitoes. Many outdoor clothing companies offer clothing that has been specially treated with permethrin, providing long-lasting protection against mosquito bites.

Tory Lord is right to pursue new media aristocrats who sullied his reputation, Keen adds. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Lord Alistair McAlpine, a prominent Tory Lord in the UK, is reportedly considering legal action against Twitter users who falsely accused him of being a pedophile. The latest battle in the Twitter war has ignited a debate about the responsibility of prominent social media users for their online activities. Andrew Keen, a media commentator, has argued that Twitter users with many followers are as liable under libel law as media companies. The allegations against Lord McAlpine were made on social media sites, including Twitter, following a BBC program which suggested that a senior Conservative party member was involved in child sex abuse. The false allegations against Lord McAlpine quickly spread on Twitter, causing irreparable damage to his reputation. As a result, Lord McAlpine has instructed lawyers to investigate the false claims made against him on Twitter. He has also threatened legal action against Twitter users who retweeted or shared defamatory content related to this case. Keen has backed McAlpine's decision to pursue legal action, arguing that social media users need to be held accountable for their actions. He suggests that those with many Twitter followers are just as liable for libel as media companies. This could have significant implications for high-profile users of social media, who may be tempted to make unfounded allegations without considering the consequences of their actions. The debate over Lord McAlpine's case highlights the challenges of regulating online content, and the need to balance free speech with the protection of individuals' reputations. While social media can be a force for good, it also has the potential to spread false or defamatory content at lightning speed, causing significant harm to individuals and organizations. In conclusion, Lord McAlpine's case serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of social media and the need for accountability in online activities. It highlights the importance of responsible social media use, and the need for regulations to protect individuals from online harassment and defamation."},{"prompt":"Based on the premise Situated 85 km (53 miles) northwest of Paris by the A13, D181, and D5, or by train from Gare StLazare to Vernon with a shuttle bus from the station to Giverny., can we conclude the hypothesis It can be accessed by road or train. is true?

Decorate your bag.","completion":"Ironing and Decorating Your Bag: A Simple and Fun DIY Project If you want to give your bag a new look, ironing out any wrinkles can be the first step towards achieving a polished finish. Depending on the material your bag is made of, you can use a conventional iron or a special ironing tool like a steamer. Be careful not to use high heat or steam on delicate fabrics, as it may damage them. Once the bag is free of wrinkles, you can move on to the fun part of decorating it. There are countless ways to personalize your bag, depending on your preferences and skills. You can use fabric paint or markers to draw designs or write messages, use iron-on transfers or patches to add images or slogans, or glue on beads, sequins, or appliqués for a more textured effect. You can also use stencils or templates to create repeatable or intricate patterns, or experiment with freehand drawing if you have artistic flair. If you are not confident in your artistic abilities, you can search for inspiration over the internet, follow tutorials or patterns, or hire a professional artist or graphic designer to help you. The key to a successful bag decoration is to work with a plan, so you can avoid mistakes or regrets later. Before you apply any permanent changes to your bag, try sketching your ideas on paper or testing them on a sample fabric or scrap material. This will help you to see how your design will look in practice, and whether you need to adjust the size, color, or placement of the elements. Once you are satisfied with your plan, you can start applying it on your bag. Take your time, and use the right materials and tools for each technique. You might need to let some decorations dry or cure for a while before handling them, so follow the instructions carefully. In conclusion, ironing and decorating your bag can be a simple and fun DIY project that allows you to express your creativity, refresh your style, and breathe new life into an old item. Whether you go for a bold and daring design or a subtle and elegant touch, the result will be a unique and eye-catching accessory that reflects your personality and tastes. So, grab your iron and your art supplies, and let your imagination run free!"},{"prompt":"Born in Moscow, Pushkin published his first poem at the age of fifteen. By the time he finished school as part of the first graduating class of the prestigious Imperial Lyceum in Tsarskoe Selo near Saint Petersburg, his talent was already widely recognized within the Russian literary scene. After school, Pushkin plunged into the vibrant and raucous intellectual youth culture of the capital, Saint Petersburg. In 1820 he published his first long poem, Ruslan and Lyudmila, amidst much controversy about its subject and style.

He went to the Caucasus and to the Crimea, then to Kamenka and Chisinau, where he became a Freemason.

Directed by Neill Blomkamp, this movie tells the story of a group of aliens who land in South Africa, only to be detained and separated from humans in a township called District 9. The movie's title is derived from this township, which is similar to the notorious District 6 of Apartheid South Africa. The movie has all the thrills and chills you expect from a top-notch sci-fi blockbuster, but it also brings a lot more to the table. It raises questions about immigration, segregation, racism, and other social issues that remain relevant today. The parallels between the aliens' confinement in District 9 and the historical oppression of black South Africans are obvious, but the movie also touches on broader themes of prejudice, exploitation, and social decay. What makes \\"District 9\\" particularly special is the way it was made. The movie was produced by relative unknowns who brought a gritty, documentary-style realism to the subject. The characters, both human and alien, feel authentic and nuanced, and the special effects are seamlessly integrated. The movie's use of found footage, interviews, and news reports adds to its verisimilitude, as if the events we are witnessing are unfolding right before our eyes. A decade after its release, \\"District 9\\" remains an essential watch. It is a testament to the power of sci-fi to grapple with important social issues and to tell compelling stories that resonate with audiences from all over the world.

He was an American chemist who made an unexpected discovery during a lab accident that would impact the world for decades to come. Coover was working for Eastman Kodak at the time, where he was assigned to find a solvent for clear plastic gun sights. He experimented with cyanoacrylates, a group of chemicals that stick to skin and other substances in seconds. However, the experiment failed, and he moved on to other projects. Years later, Coover and his team were researching heat-resistant polymers for jet canopies. He revisited the cyanoacrylate experiment and found that the chemical had potential as a glue. He spent years perfecting the formula, and in 1958, Eastman Kodak introduced Super Glue to the market. Super Glue quickly became a household name due to its strength, speed, and versatility. It could bond anything from wood to metal to plastic in seconds, making it a go-to for repairs and crafts. Coover's invention also inspired the creation of many other fast-drying adhesives. Aside from being an accomplished scientist, Coover was a devoted family man. He is survived by his three children and four grandchildren. They remember him as a loving father and grandfather, who had a passion for physics, tinkering, and playing golf.

This was summarised at the time by the slogan No taxation without representation, a perceived violation of the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen. The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards selfgovernment. In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775. The following year, in 1776, the United States declared independence. The entry of France to the war in 1778 tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms.

However, there have been no changes in the leadership of the justice and interior ministries. Experts believe that this decision may lead to further protests in the coming days. The situation is further complicated by the dwindling numbers of Tahrir Square campers after the leaking of their names. The new cabinet has a mixed bag of ministers, some who are known to be reformers and others who have been more resistant to change. This has led to a lot of speculation about the direction the government will take in the coming days. Many experts believe that failure to bring in new leadership in key ministries such as justice and interior may lead to further unrest. There are already signs that this decision may have a negative impact on the situation in the country. The recent leaks of the names of Tahrir Square campers have led to many of them leaving the site. This has also led to a sense of fear among the remaining protesters who fear that they might be targeted in the future. In conclusion, the formation of a new cabinet that includes some reformers but lacks changes in key ministries may prove to be a controversial decision. The leaking of names of Tahrir Square protesters has already led to a reduction in numbers, and it remains to be seen how this will impact the progress of the overall movement. It is clear that the government needs to tread carefully in order to avoid fueling further unrest in the country."},{"prompt":"Ekaterina Katia Alexandrovna Gordeeva (Russian: Екатерина Александровна Гордеева ) (born May 28, 1971) is a Russian (former Soviet) figure skater.

It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body.

Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow.

Tweets from the top leaders are part of new rapprochement with the West. The social media outreach comes as Iran seeks a nuclear deal to end sanctions. International sanctions crippling Iran's economy are Iran's motivation.","completion":"In a surprising turn of events, top Iranian leaders have been using social media to praise Jesus Christ as a prophet of God's grace. This move is seen as part of a new rapprochement with the West as Iran seeks a nuclear deal to end crippling international sanctions that have been plaguing the country's economy. The tweets from these Iranian leaders are a clear indication of the fact that Iran is looking to engage with the West in a more positive way. By praising Jesus Christ, they are signaling their willingness to engage with a religion that is largely practiced in the western world. This move is seen as an attempt to break down some of the religious barriers that have been between Iran and the West. It is important to note that the motivation behind this outreach is the crippling international sanctions that have been imposed on Iran. The sanctions have had a devastating impact on the Iranian economy, and the country is looking for ways to end them. By reaching out to the West in this manner, Iran is attempting to build bridges that could lead to a resolution of the sanctions issue. The use of social media in this outreach is significant as it allows for a more direct and immediate connection with the West. Twitter and other social media platforms have become an increasingly important tool for communication between countries, and Iran's use of these platforms reflects an understanding of their significance. It remains to be seen whether this new rapprochement will lead to a resolution of the nuclear issue and the subsequent lifting of sanctions on Iran. However, the fact that Iran's leaders are willing to engage with the West in this manner should be seen as a positive step towards resolving the long-standing issues between the two sides. In conclusion, the use of social media by Iranian leaders to praise Jesus Christ as a prophet of God's grace is a noteworthy development in the ongoing efforts to resolve the issues between Iran and the West. While the motives behind this outreach may be rooted in the country's economic struggles, the fact that Iran is willing to engage with the West in this manner is a significant step forward."},{"prompt":"Solve this math problem Solve 982*w 938*w + 1056 = 0 for w.","completion":"The given equation is 982*w - 938*w + 1056 = 0.

It seems to me that the creators of this movie threw in the samesex relationship between two fairly attractive women in order to attract viewers. Also consider the 90 seconds of exposing the crotches of several women jumping backwards over a high jump pole. This random scene had VERY LITTLE relevance to the movie and it appeared as though this was done merely to keep the audience interested in this bland movie. I suppose the producers were trying to counteract the boring plot and the even more boring setting of the movie (the 1980 Oregon Track and Field Competition).

Hammer et al. found that the Ychromosome of Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews contained mutations that are also common among Middle Eastern peoples, but uncommon in the general European population. This suggested that the male ancestors of the Ashkenazi Jews could be traced mostly to the Middle East. The proportion of male genetic admixture in Ashkenazi Jews amounts to less than 0.5% per generation over an estimated 80 generations, with relatively minor contribution of European Y chromosomes to the Ashkenazim, and a total admixture estimate very similar to Motulsky's average estimate of 12.5%. This supported the finding that Diaspora Jews from Europe, Northwest Africa, and the Near East resemble each other more closely than they resemble their nonJewish neighbors. Past research found that 50–80 percent of DNA from the Ashkenazi Y chromosome, which is used to trace the male lineage, originated in the Near East, Richards said.

The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body.

Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow.

However, there are a few things you need to keep in mind while using a nail gun to optimize its efficiency. Here are a few tips to make sure you are using the nail gun properly for your project. First and foremost, make sure you are using the proper frame for your nail gun. The frame is the base of the nail gun, and it comes in three different formats: clipped head, round head, and full head. You should choose the frame according to your project's requirements. Secondly, you should concern yourself with the upper and lower tools to optimize the nail gun's performance. Always check that the tools are clean and properly lubricated. This would ensure a smooth performance. Thirdly, pay attention to the tips for your upper and lower tool tips. The lower tip should be sharp to penetrate the material. The upper tip should be blunt to avoid splitting the wood. Fourthly, mind the attachments while using the nail gun. For example, if you are using a trim gun, you'll need to attach the correct tip according to the work requirement. Make sure you choose the correct attachment as per your work demand. Finally, edit your gun with circuits for better efficiency. Installing circuits in the nail gun prevents you from double-firing the nail gun, which not only saves time but also reduces the wear and tear. In conclusion, using a nail gun is an excellent way to speed up your work process, but it would help if you keep in mind these tips to get the best performance for your project.

Forces on Charged Objects Most atoms are balanced electrically. They have the same number of positive and negative charges. Therefore, the number of protons equals the number of electrons.

Aircraft launch forward, into the wind, and are recovered from astern. The flight deck is where the most notable differences between a carrier and a land runway are found. Creating such a surface at sea poses constraints on the carrier – for example, the fact that it is a ship means that a fulllength runway would be costly to construct and maintain. This affects takeoff procedure, as a shorter runway length of the deck requires that aircraft accelerate more quickly to gain lift. This either requires a thrust boost, a vertical component to its velocity, or a reduced takeoff load (to lower mass). The differing types of deck configuration, as above, influence the structure of the flight deck.

Rob Roy, by contrast, is slightly less polished, but a better film by far. This is a historical film which combines timeless themes with truly historical values, whereas Braveheart put a gross and unpleasant comtemporary gloss on an ancient tale. What makes this film is the cast. Liam Neeson plays the hero, in a role he basically reprised (in a watereddown fashion) in the Phantom Menace. The character is heroic, but is neither the greatest fighter nor the most demonic lover. Admirable yet human, he commands the screen. Against him are set a selection of equally human adversaries including Tim Roth's Cunningham, obnoxious but brilliant, and John Hurt's morally bankrupt laird. Also to praise is Jessica Lange, as Rob's pragmatic wife: also strong and noble, but 300 years away from a modern heroine, which is only as it should be.

Avoid heating with electric energy. Avoid the clothes dryer. Optimize the energy consumption of your PC. Gather up as many monthly electric bills as you can. Change your regular light bulbs to more efficient light bulbs. If you cannot or choose not to change to fluorescent light bulbs, consider using a lower powered bulb. Turn off the lights when you leave the room. Turn off all household appliances like TV's and computers when not being used. Set your thermostat wisely. Seal your windows and doors. Use cold water for just about everything except for taking a very short shower. If you live in a place where you are allowed to choose your electric company, you can easily save 20% just by switching energy companies. Each month when your bill comes, dig out your old bills and see how much you have saved.","completion":"Saving electricity is not only good for the environment, but it can also help you save money. With the rising of electric bills, it’s important to identify areas where you can reduce your energy consumption as much as possible. Here are some tips on how to save electricity at home. Refrigerators, freezers, and fridges consume a significant amount of electricity in our homes. One way to save energy is by keeping the temperature inside these appliances at the recommended level. Additionally, turning off the lights when you’re not using these appliances can reduce your energy usage significantly. For stoves and ovens, it’s best to use them together during one cooking session instead of separately. This saves time, energy, and money. Moreover, dishwashers and washing machines should be used when there are full loads. This helps to conserve both water and electricity. If possible, it is best to avoid using the air conditioner or heating with electric energy, as these require the most amount of power. Furthermore, clothes dryers consume a great deal of electricity – using a clothesline is a good alternative. Optimizing the energy consumption of your PC is an easy way to reduce electricity usage. You can lower the brightness of the screen, shut it down when not in use, and adjust the ‘sleep mode’ accordingly. Replacing your regular light bulbs with more efficient bulbs is a simple solution to saving energy. If you prefer to stick with traditional bulbs, consider using low wattage ones instead. Turn off the lights when you leave a room and unplug household appliances, including TVs and computers, when not in use. Your thermostat should be set at a temperature that ensures comfort while maintaining energy efficiency. Similarly, by sealing your windows and doors, your home is not only more comfortable, but it is also more energy-efficient as you prevent air from escaping. Finally, if you are allowed to choose your electric company, you can easily save 20% by switching energy companies. By gathering and comparing monthly electric bills, you can monitor how much you’ve saved each month. By adopting these simple tips, you can save up to thousands of dollars in electric bills every year while still minimizing your carbon footprint."},{"prompt":"Article: Unlike the Baroque style that it replaced, which was mostly used for palaces and churches, and had little representation in the British colonies, simpler Georgian styles were widely used by the upper and middle classes.

Tito's leading role in liberating Yugoslavia not only greatly strengthened his position in his party and among the Yugoslav people, but also caused him to be more insistent that Yugoslavia had more room to follow its own interests than other Bloc leaders who had more reasons (and pressures) to recognize Soviet efforts in helping them liberate their own countries from Axis control. Although Tito was formally an ally of Stalin after World War II, the Soviets had set up a spy ring in the Yugoslav party as early as 1945, giving way to an uneasy alliance.[citation needed] Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return unanswerable): Who had a leading role in liberating Yugoslavia?","completion":"Tito had a leading role in liberating Yugoslavia."},{"prompt":"Q: Scientists found a fossil of an elephant in the African savanna.

On the contrary, the visible unity of the catholic or universal church was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation. The Magisterial reformers, such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli, believed that they were reforming the Roman Catholic Church, which they viewed as having become corrupted. Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation, denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them. In order to justify their departure from the Roman Catholic Church, Protestants often posited a new argument, saying that there was no real visible Church with divine authority, only a spiritual, invisible, and hidden church—this notion began in the early days of the Protestant Reformation.

This move could result in millions of viewers having to retune their TV sets. It is believed that up to 300,000 homes may also need to install a new aerial or move their existing one. The regulator’s plan to sell frequencies to mobile phone companies will inevitably cause disruptions to Freeview and viewers. Retuning will begin in 2019 and according to estimates, the move could cost viewers £16 million. It is unknown how many people will be affected by the transition, but it is likely to be a significant number. Retuning can be a frustrating and time-consuming process for those uninitiated in the technology of their TV set, and disruption of service can cause inconvenience and frustration. Ofcom’s decision to sell frequencies is a controversial one. While it may ultimately create more revenue for mobile phone companies, it is uncertain whether viewers will benefit from it. The move is likely to cause disruption, confusion and extra costs for viewers, with little payback in the short term. In conclusion, Ofcom’s decision to sell Freeview frequencies will have an impact on millions of viewers. Retuning TV sets and the possible need to install new aerials will be a costly affair.
