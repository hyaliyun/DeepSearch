It is also intended to make clear Whitehead's rejection of the theory of representative perception, in which the mind only has private ideas about other entities. For Whitehead, the term prehension indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself. In this way, entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations, rather than being independent of them.

They stood accused of exploiting five women for money, but were cleared Wednesday of sex trafficking charges.","completion":"Vincent George Sr. and Vincent George Jr. were found guilty of money laundering and promoting prostitution. The father and son duo had been accused of exploiting five women for money but were cleared of sex trafficking charges in court on Wednesday. The charges against the Georges stem from a long-standing investigation into their alleged involvement in sex trafficking and prostitution in New York City. The prosecutors alleged that the father and son duo had forced women into prostitution, taking the majority of the profits earned by the women. The women were also subject to physical abuse and threats of violence if they did not comply with the Georges' demands. Despite being cleared of sex trafficking charges, the Georges still face up to 15 years in prison for money laundering and promoting prostitution. While the verdict will undoubtedly come as a disappointment to the accused, it represents a significant win for prosecutors who have long been battling against the proliferation of sex trafficking in the city. The case highlights the insidious nature of sex trafficking and the need for continued vigilance in combatting this horrific crime. While many people may not think of New York City as a hub for such activities, the city is, unfortunately, a hotbed for sex trafficking and prostitution. As the investigation into the Georges' activities has shown, this is not an issue that can be easily resolved. It requires the concerted efforts of law enforcement, non-profit organizations, and community members alike to raise awareness, offer support and assistance to victims. The verdict in the Georges' trial is a step in the right direction but there is still much work to be done.

These holes electrically connect the conducting layers of the PCB. For multilayer boards, those with three layers or more, drilling typically produces a smear of the high temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system. Before the holes can be plated through, this smear must be removed by a chemical desmear process, or by plasmaetch. The desmear process ensures that a good connection is made to the copper layers when the hole is plated through. On high reliability boards a process called etchback is performed chemically with a potassium permanganate based etchant or plasma.

The Baptists particularly allowed them active roles in congregations. By the mid19th century, northern Baptists tended to oppose slavery.

The EU is headquartered in Brussels, the capital of Belgium, and its various institutions and bodies require an enormous amount of paperwork. The EU is responsible for legislating on a wide range of areas, from agriculture to trade to climate change, and this requires a vast amount of documentation. From policy proposals to impact assessments to meeting minutes, the EU generates an enormous quantity of paper. In addition, the EU's administrative processes, such as recruitment and procurement, also generate significant amounts of paperwork. The impact of this on Belgium's paper consumption is significant. According to Eurostat, in 2019 Belgium used 490 kilograms of paper per capita, compared to an EU average of 165 kilograms per capita. This makes Belgium the country with the highest paper consumption per person in the world. Of course, the EU's bureaucracy is not the only factor contributing to Belgium's high paper consumption. Belgium is also home to many other international institutions, such as NATO and various UN agencies, which generate their own paperwork. However, the sheer volume of paperwork generated by the EU is undoubtedly a major factor. There are, of course, efforts underway to reduce the amount of paper used by the EU. In recent years, there has been a push towards digitalization, with more and more documents being made available online. However, this process is slow and there are a number of obstacles to overcome. Overall, while Belgium's position as the world's biggest paper consumer is largely due to the EU's bureaucracy, it is a complex issue with no easy solutions. However, it is clear that reducing paper consumption should be a priority for all organizations, including the EU, if we are to tackle the environmental challenges facing our planet."},{"prompt":"Answer this question: lord shiva wrote song for which poet name??","completion":"There is no historical record of Lord Shiva writing songs for any particular poet.

Outgoing director general Mark Thompson rejects statue idea as Orwell was 'too leftwing'","completion":"Iconic author George Orwell, known for his works Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four, worked as a political journalist for the BBC during World War Two. As a writer, Orwell was known for his strong political opinions and his commitment to social justice. Recently, there has been talk of erecting a statue of Orwell outside the BBC's headquarters to commemorate his contributions to the organization during the war. However, outgoing director general Mark Thompson has rejected the idea, citing Orwell's left-wing political views as the reason. While it is true that Orwell was a socialist and a critic of many aspects of British society, it seems short-sighted to reject the idea of commemorating him based solely on his political views. Orwell's work as a journalist for the BBC during the war was crucial in providing accurate and insightful reporting on the conflict to the British people. Moreover, Orwell's legacy as a writer and advocate for freedom of speech and individual rights has inspired generations of readers and continues to influence political discourse around the world. Erecting a statue of Orwell would not only recognize his contributions to British journalism, but also serve as a reminder of the importance of a free and independent press in a democratic society. In the end, it is disappointing to see that political considerations are preventing the recognition of a truly great writer and journalist. However, Orwell's legacy will continue to endure regardless of whether or not a statue is ever erected in his honor."},{"prompt":"You couldnt survive without your skin. It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow.

The reduction in pressure lowers the temperature at which blood and other body fluids boil, but the elastic pressure of blood vessels ensures that this boiling point remains above the internal body temperature of 37 °C. Although the blood will not boil, the formation of gas bubbles in bodily fluids at reduced pressures, known as ebullism, is still a concern. The gas may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture. Swelling and ebullism can be restrained by containment in a flight suit. Shuttle astronauts wore a fitted elastic garment called the Crew Altitude Protection Suit (CAPS) which prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kPa (15 Torr).

He spent most of his time with the San Diego Chargers, where he set numerous franchise records. One of the most impressive things about Kaeding's career was his consistency. He was known for making the vast majority of his field goals, regardless of the distance. But how much variance was there in the distances of his successful kicks? Specifically, what was the difference between Kaeding's longest and shortest field goals? To answer this question, let's start with Kaeding's longest field goal. That came during his rookie season in 2004, when he drilled a 54-yarder against the New York Jets. That kick tied the Chargers' franchise record for longest field goal, and it remained Kaeding's career high for the next six years. As for Kaeding's shortest field goal, that came during his final season in the NFL. In 2012, he was playing for the Miami Dolphins and made a 20-yard field goal against the St. Louis Rams. So, what's the difference between those two kicks? 54 - 20 = 34 The answer is that there is a 34-yard difference between Nate Kaeding's longest and shortest field goals. That's a pretty significant range, especially for a kicker known for his consistency. But it's also worth noting that Kaeding's career average for field goal distance was 36.5 yards, so the gap between his longest and shortest kicks wasn't actually that big compared to many other kickers in the league. Overall, while there was certainly some variance in the distances of Nate Kaeding's successful field goals, he was generally a very reliable kicker from any distance. Whether he was attempting a 20-yard chip shot or a 54-yard bomb, Kaeding had the skills and composure to make the kick more often than not."},{"prompt":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: For instance by payment of a lifetime even if you live longer than average or by paid to the survivor on death GNU FDL Source Wikipedia Read more","completion":"\\"For instance, by payment of a lifetime, even if you live longer than average, or by paid to the survivor on death.

Sometimes, after years of teaching, it's easy to fall into patterns and routines that lose the spark and enthusiasm that you once had. One way to reignite that passion is by attending seminars and workshops that provide new ideas, techniques, and strategies. Another way to rejuvenate your passion for teaching is by talking to past students. Often, hearing about the impact that you had on students' lives can reignite your sense of purpose and remind you of why you became a teacher in the first place. These conversations can also provide valuable insights into what worked well in your teaching and areas that could be improved. In addition to attending seminars and talking to past students, it's also essential to take care of your well-being. Teaching can be a stressful profession, and it's easy to get overwhelmed by the workload and pressure. To reduce stress, you need to find ways to relax and recharge. This could be anything from meditation and yoga to spending time with family and friends or engaging in hobbies that you enjoy. When dealing with challenging students or situations in the classroom, it's important not to take things personally. Remember that every student is unique, and what works for one may not work for another. Instead, focus on what you enjoy about teaching and the positive impact that you can have on your students' lives. Lastly, it's important to talk to someone about your frustrations. Whether it's a colleague, mentor, or loved one, having someone to confide in can be a tremendous help in dealing with the challenges of teaching. They may be able to offer advice, a listening ear, or simply be a sounding board for your thoughts and feelings. In summary, attending seminars and workshops, talking to past students, taking care of your well-being, not taking things personally, focusing on the positives, and talking to someone about your frustrations are all effective ways to regain your passion for teaching. By incorporating these strategies into your routine, you can find new and engaging ways to inspire and connect with your students, ultimately making a positive impact on their lives."},{"prompt":"Tokyo #39;s Nikkei average rose for the first time in three sessions to close 0.62 percent higher on Wednesday after investors found positive signs in revised Japanese economic growth figures that were sluggish overall.

With these simple steps, you can make a perfect plate of spaghetti every time. Step 1: Decide how much pasta to cook. Spaghetti can easily double in size when cooked, so be sure to measure the amount you'll need. A good rule of thumb is 2 ounces (57 grams) per person. Step 2: Fill a large pot with cold or cool water. Don't be tempted to add salt or oil to the water. It won't make a big difference, and it could even make the pasta slimy. Step 3: Bring the water to a boil. Use a large pot to ensure that the spaghetti has plenty of room to cook without sticking together. Step 4: Add the spaghetti to the boiling water. Stir it gently to prevent the strands from clumping together. Step 5: Cook the spaghetti for 8 to 10 minutes or until it's al dente. Keep an eye on the pot to avoid overcooking the spaghetti. Step 6: Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain it using a colander. Don't rinse the pasta with cold water as it can remove the starches that help the sauce adhere to the pasta. Spaghetti is a simple and versatile dish that can be enjoyed with a variety of sauces and toppings. By following these easy steps, you'll be able to make a perfect plate of spaghetti every time."},{"prompt":"Sentence 1: John Galliano won at 25,000 with a black cottonsatin hourglass corset covered with jeweled sprays and stars and faintly suggesting Jane Russell; followed at a great distance by a 2,000 Yoshibi Ishinuma bikini made entirely of swooping black coq feathers; and a Robert Beaulieu bikini made entirely of pale mink, available at a modest 750.

One of their key moves recently was the appointment of Cleverley as the captain by Louis van Gaal in a Roma friendly, although he could still be cut from United’s 22-man squad. If Cleverley is indeed cut, Everton is expected to make a move for the midfielder, and the transfer fee is believed to be around £8 million.

George Henry White sought to promote civil rights for blacks and to challenge efforts by white Democrats to reduce black voting by new discriminatory laws. They were unsuccessful. In 1900, the state legislature passed a new constitution, with voter registration rules that disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites. The state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by 1908. Loss of the ability to vote disqualified black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office, local, state or federal. The rising black middleclass in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the Republican Party was no longer competitive. It was not until after federal civil rights legislation was passed in the mid1960s that the majority of blacks in North Carolina would again be able to vote, sit on juries and serve in local offices.

However, some types of glue can leave a residue or wrinkle the paper, ruining the final result. That's when artist's spray adhesive comes in handy. Here's how to use artist's spray adhesive to stick paper: 1. Choose the right adhesive: Artist's spray adhesive is specifically designed for paper and other lightweight materials. As such, it's much lighter and more even than regular glue. Look for a brand that dries clear and doesn't yellow over time. 2. Prepare your workspace: To avoid getting adhesive all over your table or floor, place a towel or a sheet of paper underneath your project. Make sure the area is well-ventilated since the adhesive fumes can be harmful. 3. Apply the adhesive: Hold the can of adhesive 6-8 inches away from the back of the paper and spray a light, even coat. Avoid spraying too much, as this can cause clumps or drips. If you're using a thin or delicate paper, you may want to apply the adhesive to the surface you're sticking it to instead. 4. Wait: After spraying the adhesive, let it sit for about one minute. This will give it time to become tacky and easier to handle. 5. Stick the paper: Carefully place the paper onto the surface you want to stick it to, smoothing out any bubbles or wrinkles as you go. Once you've got it in the right position, press down firmly to make sure it sticks. 6. Let it dry: After sticking the paper, let it dry for at least an hour. This will give the adhesive time to set and prevent it from wrinkling or curling. Avoid moving the paper during this time. By following these simple steps, you can achieve a professional-looking result without the hassle of traditional glues. Just remember to choose the right adhesive for your project and apply it evenly and with care."},{"prompt":"Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: They are then put in a silver bowl and they are whisked at a rapid pace as sugar is gradually added it and the whipping continues. after OPTIONS: , they are placed in two tiara captions and the chef resumes cooking outside in the courtyard where the bride is waiting. every elf is shown again they are again shown balancing on the edge of the box and they slowly move up and down. , a soldering is peddled and the kids are unharnessed and whisked every which way behind a silver kayak until one of them is finally released and they ride through a rough highway paved with snow and steep terrain. , milk, butter, flour, banana pudding, salt and vanilla extract are shown on a table.","completion":"After the perfect peak of soft, billowy whipped cream is formed, it is ready to be served on top of a delicious dessert or hot beverage."},{"prompt":"ere is some data: Michigan, language, Arabic.

From the poor acting to the awful special effects, this film is a prime example of what happens when a talented director (M. Night Shyamalan) loses his touch. The cast, which includes Noah Ringer, Dev Patel, and Nicola Peltz, delivers some of the most wooden performances I've ever seen. Their line deliveries are stilted and emotionless, which makes it impossible to care about the characters or become invested in the story. The special effects are equally terrible. The CGI creatures and landscapes are poorly rendered and look like they were created on a shoestring budget. The fight scenes also suffer from bad choreography and are poorly executed, resulting in a lackluster experience. What's even worse is that \\"The Last Airbender\\" is a complete betrayal of the beloved animated series on which it's based. Shyamalan completely botches the source material and fails to capture any of the humor or heart that made the show so special.

Overnight stains are considered a fair sign and your dog may be able to fight eye infection.

Pure oxidation relies heavily on the presence of nitrates in the skin so that eventually the stain will disappear. Just like hair dye, it takes a while for the porphyrin to stain fur. Tear staining is a result of tears not being wiped away before the fur gets stained. Though stain removal is quick and easy, it costs significantly more than professional bleaching to stop the stain. The chemical can remove minor stains, acidic stains, and others, but it can generally not be removed in a single stroke.","completion":"Just like hair dye, it takes a while for the porphyrin to stain fur.

This means that even if a majority of people in a state support a certain party or policy, the state government may not reflect this. - Campaign finance: political campaigns are often funded by wealthy donors, which can give these individuals and corporations disproportionate influence over the policies and candidates that the state prioritizes. - Lobbying: interest groups and lobbyists often have more access to politicians and government institutions than ordinary citizens, which can lead to policies that favor the interests of these groups over the interests of the broader population.

This remarkable feat was achieved by kicker Matt Prater of the Denver Broncos on December 8, 2013 during a game against the Tennessee Titans. Prater's record-breaking kick exceeded the previous record of 63 yards set by Tom Dempsey of the New Orleans Saints in 1970 and later matched by Jason Elam of the Broncos in 1998 and David Akers of the San Francisco 49ers in 2012. While 64 yards is an impressive accomplishment, it should be noted that the conditions in which the kick was made can significantly impact its likelihood of success. Factors including wind, temperature, and altitude can all affect the trajectory and distance of a field goal attempt. In Prater's case, the game was being played at Sports Authority Field at Mile High, which sits at an elevation of over 5,000 feet above sea level. This thin air can make the ball travel further than it would at lower altitudes, giving kickers a slight advantage. Regardless of the circumstances, however, kicking a 64-yard field goal requires tremendous skill and precision. Kicking specialists train for years to master their craft, practicing their form and technique in a variety of conditions to prepare for game situations. While breaking the record for longest field goal may not be the ultimate goal for every kicker, it is certainly a milestone that is revered throughout the football world."},{"prompt":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Humphrey Arthur Gilkes MC & Three Bars (13 October 1895 – 11 July 1945) was a British soldier and doctor.

Nikolai Trubetzkoy in Grundzüge der Phonologie (1939) defines phonology as the study of sound pertaining to the system of language, as opposed to phonetics, which is the study of sound pertaining to the act of speech (the distinction between language and speech being basically Saussure's distinction between langue and parole). More recently, Lass (1998) writes that phonology refers broadly to the subdiscipline of linguistics concerned with the sounds of language, while in more narrow terms, phonology proper is concerned with the function, behavior and organization of sounds as linguistic items.

Avoid using hurtful words.","completion":"When it comes to communication, it's important to remember a few key principles to ensure that your interactions with others are positive and respectful. First and foremost, it's essential to talk about what you need. Too often, people keep their feelings or desires to themselves, assuming that others will just figure it out. But the truth is, most people can't read minds, and if you don't communicate what you need, you're unlikely to get it. At the same time, it's also important to know when to listen. Communication is a two-way street, and if you're always talking and never listening, you're not really communicating effectively. When someone is talking to you, make sure you're really hearing what they're saying, and try to understand their perspective. This will help you to build stronger relationships and avoid misunderstandings. Another important principle of effective communication is giving support. If someone comes to you with a problem or a difficult situation, try to be there for them in whatever way you can. This could mean providing emotional support, offering practical advice, or just being a good listener. Helping others can be incredibly rewarding and can strengthen your relationships with the people in your life. Finally, it's important to be mindful of the words you use when you communicate. Hurtful words can cause long-lasting damage to your relationships and can make it difficult for others to trust or respect you. Be mindful of the impact that your words might have, and try to use language that is kind, respectful, and positive. This will help you build stronger and healthier relationships with the people in your life. In summary, effective communication involves talking about what you need, listening to others, giving support, and using language that is positive and respectful.

Set the derivative equal to 0. Solve for the number of items at the 0 value. Calculate the maximum price. Combine the results to calculate maximum revenue. Summarize the results.","completion":"Calculating the maximum revenue for a company is an important task for any business owner or investor. To do so, we need to find the first derivative of the revenue function, set it equal to 0, solve for the number of items at the 0 value, and calculate the maximum price. We can then combine these results to determine the maximum revenue and summarize our findings. Firstly, the revenue function describes the relationship between the number of items sold and the price of each item. By finding the derivative of this function, we can determine the rate of change of revenue with respect to the number of items sold. Setting the derivative equal to 0 allows us to find the point at which revenue is neither increasing nor decreasing, i.e., the maximum point. Solving the equation for the number of items at this point will give us the quantity that should be produced to maximize revenue. Once we have determined the optimal number of items, we can calculate the maximum price by substituting this value into the revenue function. The resulting price will be the highest that the market will bear, allowing us to maximize revenue. Finally, we can combine these results to calculate the maximum revenue. The optimal quantity can be multiplied by the optimal price to obtain the maximum revenue that the company can generate. In summary, finding the maximum revenue for a company involves finding the derivative of the revenue function, setting it to 0 to find the optimal quantity, calculating the maximum price, and combining these results to determine the maximum revenue. By following this process, businesses can make informed decisions about production and pricing strategies that will help them maximize their profits."},{"prompt":"Concepts: cheese, pizza, smother Write a sentence that includes all these words.","completion":"I love to smother my pizza with lots of cheesy goodness."},{"prompt":"Today is Gaea 's and I 5th wedding anniversary ! !

Find out if the patent has expired. Argue that your item or invention is sufficiently different from the patented item.","completion":"When considering launching a new product or invention, it's crucial to research the validity of any existing patents that may be relevant. This involves finding out if the patent is still in effect, as well as assessing whether your product is different enough from the patented item to avoid potential infringement. To start, it's important to understand that patents have a limited lifespan. For utility patents, which cover new and useful processes, machines, articles of manufacture, and compositions of matter, the maximum term is 20 years from the date of filing. For design patents, which cover new, original, and ornamental designs for an article of manufacture, the maximum term is 15 years from the date of filing. If the patent in question has expired, then there is no longer any risk of infringement. However, if the patent is still in effect, it's important to assess whether your item or invention is sufficiently different from the patented item to avoid infringing on the patent holder's rights. One way to do this is to conduct a patent search to find out the specific claims that are covered by the existing patent. Once you know what is and isn't covered, you can compare your product or invention to see if it will be seen as sufficiently different in the eyes of the law. It's also important to look at the purpose and function of the patented item, as well as any potential design elements or features that may be relevant. If your product or invention is significantly different in any of these areas, it could potentially be argued that it does not infringe on the patent. In summary, before launching a new product or invention, it's crucial to research the validity of any relevant patents and determine if they have expired or if your item is sufficiently different to avoid infringement. By taking this step, you can avoid potential legal disputes and ensure that your product has a clear path to success."},{"prompt":"Tropical climates are found around the equator.

Peacekeeping forces are typically made up of military personnel from different countries who are sent to areas of conflict with the aim of restoring peace and preventing further violence. One of the main advantages of a peacekeeping force is that it serves as a neutral third party in the conflict. This means that neither side should feel threatened or biased towards the other. Another advantage of a peacekeeping force is that it can often act as a deterrent to further violence by being visible and showing strength. However, for a peacekeeping force to be effective, it needs to arrive as soon as possible after the conflict breaks out. If a peacekeeping force had arrived earlier in many conflicts, it could have potentially stopped the fighting and prevented the loss of countless lives. For example, during the Rwandan genocide in 1994, it is estimated that up to 1 million people were killed. The United Nations received reports of the impending genocide in early 1994, but the peacekeeping force that eventually arrived was not deployed until after much of the violence had already occurred. Similarly, during the Syrian civil war, a peacekeeping force may have been able to prevent much of the violence and displacement of millions of people if it had arrived earlier. However, international politics and disagreements prevented the deployment of such a force. In conclusion, a peacekeeping force is a potential force that could stop the fighting if it had arrived earlier in conflicts. The presence of such a force could act as a deterrent to further violence and provide a neutral third party to mediate and negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict."},{"prompt":"From the following options, what is the question What toy can you make sleep ? asking about?

One of the main reasons was the mounting domestic pressure in America against the occupation. This pressure led to changes in the government's policy towards Nicaragua, forcing President Franklin D. Roosevelt to bring the occupation to an end. Another critical factor that contributed to the end of the occupation was the deteriorating economic situation in the country. The Great Depression had severely affected America's economy, and it became increasingly expensive to maintain military personnel and resources in Nicaragua. The country's infrastructure and economy were also in disarray, making it challenging to continue the occupation. The opposition from other Latin American countries to the occupation also played a role in the USA's decision to leave. Nicaragua had become a source of resentment and hostility from other countries in the region who saw the USA's presence as an imperialistic move. The USA was keen to maintain strong relations with other countries in the region and saw ending the occupation as a way to do so. Finally, the American military leadership had also recognized that the occupation had achieved its stated goals, and there was no need to maintain such a large presence in the country. By the mid-1930s, Nicaragua had become a stable and democratic country, and the USA's mission to establish order and stability had been accomplished. In summary, the USA ended its occupation of Nicaragua due to a combination of factors, including domestic pressures, economic considerations, opposition from other Latin American countries, and recognition that the occupation had achieved its intended goals. The end of the occupation marked an important moment in the history of Nicaragua and the region, setting the stage for the country's future development and growth."},{"prompt":"Do these mean the same?

Consider waiting until you have received your bankruptcy discharge. Examine the feasibility of buying a car with cash. Discuss your plans with your trustee. Obtain the necessary paperwork. Prepare to make a large down payment. Find a lender. Choose an affordable car. Expect a higher interest rate.","completion":"Chapter 7 bankruptcy is a legal process that can eliminate most of your unsecured debts. However, it also has strict parameters that you need to understand before making any major financial decisions. If you are considering buying a car after filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, here are some important things to keep in mind: First, it's crucial to wait until after you have received your bankruptcy discharge to take on any new debt. This is because any new debt incurred before your discharge may not be eligible for discharge, which means you could still be liable for paying it back. Once you have your discharge, you can start rebuilding your credit and financing major purchases like a car. Before you start shopping for a car, it's a good idea to examine the feasibility of buying it with cash. This is because getting approved for a car loan after bankruptcy can be challenging, and you may have to pay a higher interest rate. If you do decide to buy with cash, discuss your plans with your bankruptcy trustee first to ensure that you are staying within the rules and guidelines of your bankruptcy case. If you do need to take out a car loan, you will need to obtain the necessary paperwork and prepare to make a large down payment. Many lenders require a down payment of at least 10% to 20% of the car's purchase price, especially if your credit score is low. Having a substantial down payment can increase your chances of getting approved and may also help you secure a better interest rate. When it comes to finding a lender, there are a few options to consider. You can work with a traditional bank or credit union, or you can look for lenders that specialize in working with people who have bad credit or have recently gone through bankruptcy. Keep in mind that these lenders may charge higher interest rates and fees, so it's important to shop around and compare your options. Lastly, when choosing a car, it's important to be realistic and choose something that is affordable. This means considering both the purchase price and the ongoing expenses of owning a car, like insurance, maintenance, and gas. You should also expect a higher interest rate than you would get with a good credit score, so factor this into your budget as well. In summary, buying a car after Chapter 7 bankruptcy requires careful consideration and planning. It's important to wait until after your discharge, explore the option of buying with cash, discuss your plans with your trustee, obtain the necessary paperwork, make a large down payment, find a lender, and choose an affordable car. By following these steps, you can help ensure that you stay within the parameters of your bankruptcy case and set yourself up for success in the future."},{"prompt":"Now, there's more work to do.

Borrowing somewhat from the pneuma of Stoic physics, aether came to be regarded as the rarefied air from which it took its name, (see Aether (mythology)). Early theories of light posited a ubiquitous terrestrial and celestial medium through which light propagated. Additionally, the concept informed Isaac Newton's explanations of both refraction and of radiant heat. 19th century experiments into this luminiferous aether attempted to detect a minute drag on the Earth's orbit. While the Earth does, in fact, move through a relatively dense medium in comparison to that of interstellar space, the drag is so minuscule that it could not be detected. In 1912, astronomer Henry Pickering commented: While the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether, [it] is characteristic of a gas, and free gaseous molecules are certainly there.

The tragedy came just 10 months after her brother, Dr Michael Chye, was shot dead, and both cases remain unsolved to this day. However, news broke in 2017 that a breakthrough in the case was imminent, with Rita's brother-in-law, Gerard Caleo, being extradited from Thailand to Australia to face charges of her murder. Mr Caleo, who was just 18 years old at the time of the killing, had been living in Phuket, where he served as the general manager of the Hard Rock Cafe. The case has been shrouded in mystery for almost 30 years, with many speculating that the two murders were connected in some way, given how close they were together. Some residents of Sydney's eastern suburbs, where the killings occurred, even went as far as to suggest that there was a hitman operating in the area. However, the truth remains elusive, and it is not yet clear what motivated the killings, or whether anyone else was involved. The extradition of Mr Caleo has certainly renewed interest in the case and raised hopes that long-awaited answers may finally be forthcoming. For the families of the victims, the saga has been a long and painful one, with both murders having a significant impact on their lives. However, they have remained determined to see justice done, and it seems that they may be one step closer to that goal. As the legal proceedings continue, Australians will be watching closely to see what new information emerges and whether the murderer or murderers will finally be brought to justice. The fate of the victims and their families may hinge on what we learn in the coming months and years."},{"prompt":"Dialogue: Di: Make sure you get crack dens proxy if they're not in arrears Jo: Jeebus, which one is that? 546 moved, 987 has always been in arrears. who am I missing? smh Di: 123 Jo: That guy is an asshole Di: Sadly, even assholes have rights What is a summary of this dialogue?","completion":"Di asks Jo to get the proxy from the crack den which is not in arrears.

Ask the doctor about laser treatment to lighten scars. Receive minor skin surgery to remove the boil scar tissue. Request a chemical peel to clear boil scars from a large area of skin. Talk to your doctor about corticosteroid injections to flatten scars.","completion":"Boils can be a painful and uncomfortable skin condition that may leave scars behind. These scars can be unsightly and affect one's confidence. However, there are various treatments available to clear boil scars, and it is essential to see a dermatologist if scars do not clear up with treatment. One effective treatment for lightening scars is laser treatment. Laser treatment can target the affected area, reducing discoloration and encouraging collagen production. This helps to reduce scarring and improve the overall appearance of the skin. Minor skin surgery is another option for removing boil scar tissue. The dermatologist can perform a minor surgical procedure to remove the scar tissue, which can significantly reduce the appearance of scars. Chemical peels are another treatment for clearing boil scars from a large area of the skin. Chemical peels use an acidic solution to peel away the top layer of skin, revealing a smoother and more even complexion underneath. This treatment may not be suitable for everyone, so it is essential to talk to a dermatologist to determine if this treatment is right for you. Corticosteroid injections are another option for flattening scars. This treatment involves injecting a steroid solution into the affected area, reducing inflammation and flattening the scar. This option may be a good choice if there is noticeable hypertrophic or keloid scarring. It is important to note that not all treatments may be suitable for everyone, and it is crucial to consult a dermatologist before starting any scar treatment. Additionally, it may take several sessions or a combination of treatments to achieve the desired results. Nonetheless, with proper care and treatment, boil scars can be significantly reduced or eliminated, leading to healthier and more radiant-looking skin."},{"prompt":"Does the sentence This early example of a corporate logo, introduced as part of Herbert Chapman's rebranding of the club in the 1930s, was used not only on Cup Final shirts but as a design feature throughout Highbury Stadium, including above the main entrance and inlaid in the floors. provide a valid answer to the question What style of logo did Chapman introduce in the 1930s?

Electrically this forms a single 1⁄2wavelength element. But the overall current pattern is the same; the current will be zero at the two ends, and reach a maximum in the center. Thus signals near the design frequency will continue to create a standing wave pattern. Any varying electrical current, like the standing wave in the element, will radiate a signal. In this case, aside from resistive losses in the element, the rebroadcast signal will be significantly similar to the original signal in both magnitude and shape. If this element is placed so its signal reaches the main dipole inphase, it will reinforce the original signal, and increase the current in the dipole. Elements used in this way are known as passive elements.

If you need to insulate your windows quickly and at a low cost, kitchen foil may be just the trick. However, for long-term insulation solutions, more durable materials may be necessary. To use aluminum foil as temporary window insulation, follow these steps: 1. Determine the Shape of Your Window: Depending on the shape of your window, you’ll need to measure and cut the foil to fit either vertically or horizontally. 2. Cut out Your Foil Pieces: Measure the height and width of your window and cut out foil pieces that will match these dimensions. 3. Install the Foil: Place the foil over the window, making sure to cover the entire surface. Press the edges down securely to create a seal. For added stability and durability, consider creating a foil-wrapped insert. To do this, cut a piece of foam insulation to the exact size of your window and wrap it in aluminum foil. Not only will this create a more stable insulation surface, but it will also provide a more polished and professional look. In conclusion, while aluminum foil can be a quick and easy solution for temporary window insulation, it may not be a long-lasting solution.

However, he later denied the allegations and accused the police of staging a conspiracy to ruin his career. During the hearing, Sir Bernard was asked if he had authorized the press briefings that seemed to portray Mitchell in a negative light. He firmly denied any involvement in the matter. He also reiterated that the police's original account of the incident was accurate, indicating that Mitchell did use derogatory language towards the police officers.

Hayden says reforms require briefers to cover full range of intelligence theories. The incorrect description of the attack fits pattern of wishful thinking on terrorism, he says.","completion":"Former CIA Director Michael Hayden has weighed in on the confusion surrounding the Benghazi attack of 2012. In a recent interview, Hayden placed blame on intelligence briefers for the misinformation that emerged following the incident. However, he also acknowledged that this was part of a broader pattern of wishful thinking about terrorism that has plagued intelligence agencies for years. To address this problem, Hayden believes that intelligence briefers need to cover the full range of theories when presenting information. This means examining both positive and negative outcomes, as well as considering the possibility of conflicting sources. By avoiding the trap of wishful thinking, intelligence agencies can better evaluate the risks associated with potential threats. Hayden also pointed to the incorrect initial description of the Benghazi attack as evidence of this pattern. The lack of a consistent and accurate narrative in the early days was due in part to the intelligence community's overly optimistic view of the situation. Officials were initially hesitant to label the attack as terrorism for fear of provoking a backlash against American interests abroad. In conclusion, Michael Hayden's comments on the Benghazi attack underscore the importance of clear, unbiased intelligence briefings. By avoiding the tendency towards wishful thinking, intelligence communities can make more informed decisions about potential threats. Moving forward, it will be crucial for briefers to examine all possible outcomes when presenting information. This will require a shift in mindset from always seeking positive outcomes to a more nuanced and realistic approach."},{"prompt":"Mel: I've just seen Bohemian Rapsody Trish: Cool.

If there is any stubborn dirt left, you can scrub the fishbowl with vinegar. This helps to remove any limescale build-up, and bacteria that may have accumulated on the bowl's surface. Make sure to rinse the bowl thoroughly with hot water after using vinegar to avoid harming the fish. Once the bowl is clean, it's time to set it up again.

While a grazing species such as an elephant may travel many kilometers in a single day, grazing on many plants in the process, parasites form very close associations with their hosts, usually having only one or at most a few in their lifetime. This close living arrangement may be described by the term symbiosis, living together, but unlike mutualism the association significantly reduces the fitness of the host. Parasitic organisms range from the macroscopic mistletoe, a parasitic plant, to microscopic internal parasites such as cholera. Some species however have more loose associations with their hosts. Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) larvae may feed parasitically on only a single plant, or they may graze on several nearby plants.

This division was a result of the Potsdam Conference, where the Allied Powers determined the post-World War II boundaries in Europe. Lower Silesia was previously a part of Germany, but after the war, it was annexed by Poland and the eastern part was given to Czechoslovakia. The division resulted in significant changes for the people who lived in Lower Silesia. Many Germans who had lived in the region for generations were forced to leave their homes and properties behind and relocate to Germany. This was a consequence of the resettlement efforts to shift ethnic populations in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The Polish administration of Lower Silesia involved significant efforts to rebuild the region after the damages caused by the war. Large scale investments in infrastructure and industry were undertaken, and a program of land reforms was implemented to redistribute land to Polish settlers. The region also saw an influx of people from other parts of Poland and Eastern Europe, further altering the demographic landscape. The Czech part of Lower Silesia also underwent significant changes. The area around the city of Ostrava, which had been a major industrial center, was incorporated into Czechoslovakia and became a hub of coal mining and heavy industry. The city of Bruntál also became home to a number of Czech settlers, who were encouraged to relocate to the area. In summary, Lower Silesia was divided between Poland and Czechoslovakia after 1945 as part of the post-war settlement.

Napoleon had ordered the seizure of the convent to use it as a military hospital for his troops. However, the nuns refused to evacuate the premises and instead decided to confront the French army head-on. The nuns gathered together and, armed only with rosary beads, stood in front of the convent entrance, blocking the French soldiers' passage. The soldiers were reluctant to use force against the nuns and were impressed by their bravery and determination. The nuns explained that they were willing to die to defend their convent and the Church. Napoleon was eventually informed of the situation and decided not to risk further confrontation with the nuns. He ordered his troops to leave the convent untouched and to find another location for the military hospital. The nuns' courageous stand had saved their convent and prevented Napoleon from gaining control of a strategic location. The nuns' act of bravery earned them recognition from both the Italian and French governments. In 1816, Pope Pius VII granted the nuns honorary medals in recognition of their courage and devotion to the Church. Their actions have been celebrated ever since as an example of faith and courage in the face of tyranny. In conclusion, the nuns' refusal to surrender their convent to Napoleon's army was a brave act that prevented the French emperor from gaining ground in the war of 1812. Their selfless actions, armed only with their faith and rosary beads, have been celebrated as an example of valor and heroism in the face of adversity. Their story serves as a reminder that even the most vulnerable among us can stand up to tyranny and make a difference."},{"prompt":"The father of an Oxnard teenager accused of gunning down a gay classmate who was romantically attracted to him has been found dead, Ventura County authorities said today.

Avoid drinking water or other beverages while you’re eating. Chew with your mouth closed to reduce the air you swallow. Remove outside distractions so you can focus on your meal. Place your utensils down on the table after each bite.","completion":"It's no secret that healthy eating habits can impact our overall well-being. But did you know that the way in which we eat can also affect our digestive health? By following a few simple guidelines, we can improve our digestion and feel better after our meals. Firstly, it's important to cut larger foods into smaller pieces. This makes it easier for our digestive system to break down the food, and reduces the amount of work it has to do. Be sure to take smaller bites as well, as this decreases the amount of air we swallow, which can lead to bloating and discomfort. It's also best to avoid drinking water or other beverages while we eat. This can dilute our stomach acid, and slow down the digestive process. If you're thirsty while eating, try taking small sips between bites. Chewing with our mouth closed is another helpful tip that can aid in digestion. This reduces the amount of air we swallow, and also helps to break down our food more thoroughly. Plus, it's simply good manners! Removing outside distractions, such as phones or televisions, can help us focus on our meal. This allows us to be more mindful of what we're eating, and can actually help us feel more satisfied with less food. Finally, placing our utensils down on the table after each bite can help us slow down and enjoy our meal. This encourages us to chew more thoroughly and take smaller bites, both of which are beneficial for digestion. By following these five simple tips, we can improve our digestive health and feel better after our meals. So next time you sit down to eat, remember to cut, chew, and savor each bite. Your stomach (and your taste buds!) will thank you."},{"prompt":"Self resolving anaphylaxis is unstable because it can kick in again at any time , so she was taken to hospital with adrenaline on stand by .

Bituminous sands are mined using enormous (100 ton capacity) power shovels and loaded into even larger (400 ton capacity) dump trucks for movement to an upgrading facility. The process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by Dr. Karl Clark of the University of Alberta during the 1920s. After extraction from the sand, the bitumen is fed into a bitumen upgrader which converts it into a light crude oil equivalent. This synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional oil pipelines and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment. By 2015 Canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over 1 million barrels (160×10^3 m3) per day of synthetic crude oil, of which 75% was exported to oil refineries in the United States.

However, there are several ways to treat them effectively. One of the most effective ways is by applying a topical retinoid over the affected area. This can help to lighten the spots by promoting cell turnover and increasing collagen production. Another effective treatment for sunspots is to apply hydroquinone, which can bleach away unwanted pigmentation. This can be particularly effective for those with darker skin tones. However, it is important to note that hydroquinone can be irritating to some people, so it is important to test it on a small patch of skin before applying it to the affected area. For a more natural remedy, products that contain kojic acid can also help to lighten sunspots. This ingredient has been shown to be effective in inhibiting the production of melanin, which is responsible for skin pigmentation. It is important to use these products at night before going to bed, as sunlight can reduce the effectiveness of kojic acid. Overall, there are several effective ways to treat sunspots, and it is important to find the method that works best for your skin. Using a combination of these methods can also be effective in achieving a brighter, more even complexion.

Fragments of willow basket were found near the Glastonbury Lake Village, and it was also used in the construction of several Iron Age causeways. The willow was harvested using a traditional method of pollarding, where a tree would be cut back to the main stem. During the 1930s more than 3,600 hectares (8,900 acres) of willow were being grown commercially on the Levels.

In continental Europe, on the other hand, the postwar decades saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy, with Marxism dominating the field. This was the time of JeanPaul Sartre and Louis Althusser, and the victories of Mao Zedong in China and Fidel Castro in Cuba, as well as the events of May 1968 led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology, especially by the New Left. A number of continental European émigrés to Britain and the United States—including Karl Popper, Friedrich Hayek, Leo Strauss, Isaiah Berlin, Eric Voegelin and Judith Shklar—encouraged continued study in political philosophy in the AngloAmerican world, but in the 1950s and 1960s they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment.
