Oracle is the cloud provider of choice, and the partnership with Walmart is in the works. The deal is still pending approval from the US government, but it is expected to pass without much trouble. Oracle and Walmart will both take a 20% stake in the new entity called TikTok Global. The partnership with Walmart is expected to provide a substantial boost to TikTok's operations, as Walmart has a massive retail presence and digital capabilities. This will enable TikTok to expand its offerings and services to its vast user base, ultimately resulting in increased revenues for the company. Furthermore, having Oracle as a cloud provider is a significant step for TikTok as it ensures the security of the platform's data. TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, has faced scrutiny from countries around the world over privacy and security concerns. Oracle's reputation for security and data management will go a long way in addressing these issues and maintaining TikTok's user base's trust. The creation of TikTok Global, a new entity that Oracle and Walmart will own a stake in, will help alleviate concerns regarding the Chinese government's control over TikTok's operations.

The Delhi government has declared a public health emergency. Schools have been closed, flights have been diverted, and construction has been halted. Experts warn that the polluted air can cause serious health problems.","completion":"India's capital city, New Delhi, is currently being smothered in a blanket of extreme air pollution. The situation has become so severe that the Delhi government has declared a public health emergency. Schools have been closed, flights have been diverted, and construction work has been halted as the city struggles to deal with the dangerous levels of smog. The harmful pollutants in the air pose a serious threat to public health. Experts warn that long-term exposure to the polluted air can cause lung diseases, heart disease, and other serious health problems. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that air pollution is responsible for around 7 million deaths worldwide each year. The main sources of Delhi's air pollution are vehicle emissions, industrial pollution, and the burning of crop stubble in neighboring states. The problem is compounded by the geography of the region, which means that the pollution gets trapped in the city instead of being blown away by the wind. The Delhi government has implemented a number of measures to try and address the pollution crisis, such as temporarily suspending all construction work and banning the use of diesel generators. The government has even gone as far as to distribute free face masks to the public to help protect them from the hazardous air. However, many experts believe that the situation requires more drastic action, such as imposing stricter vehicle emissions controls, investing in public transportation, and promoting renewable energy sources. In the meantime, the people of Delhi are left to struggle with the immediate effects of the polluted air. Residents are being advised to avoid outdoor activities as much as possible and to wear masks if they do need to go outside. The elderly, children and those with pre-existing health conditions are particularly at risk and should take extra precautions. The current air pollution crisis in Delhi serves as a stark reminder of the need for urgent action to address the global problem of air pollution.

The soaring price comes as more mainstream financial institutions and companies such as Tesla continue to embrace the digital currency, adding to its legitimacy and fueling demand. Despite its growing popularity, Bitcoin remains an extremely volatile investment, with sharp price swings that can occur in a matter of hours. Moreover, cryptocurrencies are not subject to regulation like traditional assets, leading many critics to view Bitcoin as a risky investment. Amid the ongoing boom of cryptocurrencies, governments globally are considering impositions of limitations on its use.

Despite these risks, Bitcoin's rise remains seemingly unstoppable as more institutions and investors flock to invest in digital currencies. Additionally, increased adoption is leading to more widespread use cases for cryptocurrency, with some even considering cryptocurrencies as a potential alternative to traditional currencies in the future.

Include statistics and examples to support your arguments.

According to research, social media usage correlates with increased rates of depression, anxiety, and cyberbullying. For example, a study revealed that heavy social media users were 2.7 times more likely to experience depression than those who used it less frequently. Additionally, a person spends an average of 2 hours and 24 minutes per day on social media, according to a recent report. One possible cause of social media’s negative impact is the phenomenon called “social comparison theory,” where people compare themselves to others on social media, leading to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. Another potential cause is cyberbullying, which can have a severe impact on young people's mental health. According to a study by the Council of Europe, cyberbullying affects 1 in 8 young people daily. To mitigate the effects of social media on mental health, we can take various actions. One possible step is to raise awareness of the consequences of social media use through campaigns targeted towards young people. A second solution is to limit social media usage and increase time spent on other activities, such as physical exercises or engaging with family and friends. Finally, social media platforms should actively target cyberbullying and hate speech through regulation and enforcement. In conclusion, social media has a significant impact on mental health, with research pointing to increased levels of depression, anxiety, and cyberbullying.

By Tim Stickings For Mailonline. Published: 10:36 EST, 16 January 2020 | Updated: 10:56 EST, 16 January 2020 A sevenyearold boy named Jhansi, in northern India, has set a new record with his exceptional memory. Jhansi, who lives in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, can hold on to an unfeasibly large amount of information, thanks to his eidetic memory. This week, Jhansi impressed a large audience by reciting 54 digits in only 27 seconds as part of a memory contest in the state capital. OPTIONS: Although this unique skill will undoubtedly serve him well in later life, there is no guarantee that it will provide him with a competitive advantage when it comes to finding work. Jhansi will now go on to represent his school in the regionals and, if successful, could compete in the national memory championships later this year. While it is still unclear how this extraordinary talent can be harnessed for the greater good, many scientists are interested in learning more about his memory processes. While there is no doubt that this is an incredible feat for a child of his age, many critics have argued that it remains to be seen if he will be able to retain his exceptional powers in adulthood. It is believed that Jhansi could eventually rival Kim Peek, the inspiration behind the Oscarwinning film 'Rain Man', who was famed for his extraordinary memory skills. Jhansi's parents are understandably concerned that their son's unique abilities could attract unwanted attention and exploitation, and are keen to ensure he remains grounded despite his newfound fame. It remains to be seen whether Jhansi's recordbreaking skills will be of any practical use to him in the years to come. It is hoped that Jhansi's remarkable talent can be used to inspire other children to develop their own memory skills and to become lifelong learners. The audience was left stunned as the sevenyearold almost effortlessly rattled off 54 digits from memory, making it clear that he is a child prodigy with an extraordinary gift.

Hence, individuals can take steps to shop sustainably by buying products with little or no packaging, using reusable bags, and buying products made from environmentally friendly materials. 3. Reduce waste: Waste disposal also contributes significantly to environmental pollution. Individuals can minimize the amount of waste generated by practicing recycling, disposing of hazardous waste correctly, and avoiding the use of disposable items where possible. 4. Plant and protect trees: Trees are essential for taking up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, converting it to oxygen and storing the carbon in their biomass. Individuals can contribute to reversing the effects of climate change by planting and protecting trees in their communities or supporting organizations actively planting them. 5. Support policies and actions that mitigate climate change: Governments and organizations can also play a role in mitigating the effects of climate change. Individuals can contribute by supporting policies that encourage renewable energy, reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, and sustainable practices.

For something more delicate, try butter lettuce, mesclun or spring mix. Wash the greens and dry them well, using a salad spinner if you have one. Next, add chopped vegetables and fruits. Aim for a balance of flavors and colors. Try adding diced cucumbers, bell peppers, tomatoes, and radishes for crunch and color. For sweetness, you can also add sliced apples, berries, or pears. Then, add a protein such as grilled chicken, shrimp, or tofu. This will make your salad filling and satisfying. If you want to keep things plant-based, you can add chickpeas, lentils, or quinoa instead. Finally, top with your choice of dressing. The dressing is what brings the whole salad together, so make sure it’s one you love. You can make your own dressing with olive oil, vinegar, herbs, and spices, or choose a store-bought option. Some popular choices include classic vinaigrette, honey mustard, or balsamic. When assembling your salad, be creative! Experiment with new ingredients and combinations.

They can affect individuals' quality of life, relationships, work productivity, and even physical health. Depression and anxiety, for example, are among the leading causes of disability worldwide.

Improved mental health awareness and care can help families to better support their loved ones. Moreover, mental health issues do not discriminate between individuals, and almost anyone can experience mental health problems. It is, therefore, essential to promote mental health awareness and educate people about the signs and symptoms of mental illness. Recognizing mental health issues in oneself or others can prompt early intervention and improve outcomes. Lastly, reducing the stigma associated with mental health disorders can encourage people to seek help without feeling ashamed or embarrassed. Addressing mental health concerns as just another medical condition is necessary for providing adequate treatment and support without discrimination. In conclusion, prioritizing mental health awareness and care should be a top priority for individuals, families, and society at large. By acknowledging the importance of mental well-being, promoting awareness, providing resources and care, and reducing stigma, individuals can live healthier, happier, and more fulfilling lives."},{"prompt":"Natasha: What's the weather like today?

However, I can provide some information on the topic to help you formulate your own essay. The use of standardized testing in schools is a widely debated topic.

They also argue that standardized tests can identify achievement gaps and help schools adjust their curriculum to address areas where students may be struggling. On the other hand, opponents of standardized testing argue that it places too much emphasis on test scores and fails to measure other important aspects of learning such as creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. They also argue that standardized tests can cause stress for students and teachers, and may unfairly disadvantage certain student populations such as those from low-income families or those with learning disabilities. Ultimately, whether or not to use standardized testing in schools is a complex issue with arguments on both sides.

Researchers at Brock University in Canada used information from two UK longitudinal studies that included cognitive tests and questions about social attitudes spanning five decades.

The researchers say that even short visits to natural settings can have a positive effect on mental health, and suggest that doctors should consider prescribing time in nature as a way to treat anxiety and depression. Expand this summary.","completion":"With the rise of mental health awareness and its impact on people's everyday lives, researchers are constantly exploring new ways to help individuals cope with issues such as anxiety and depression. The latest study in this field has highlighted the positive effects of spending time in nature on mental health. The study, conducted by researchers from the University of Michigan and the University of Tokyo, surveyed about 20,000 individuals in Japan about their daily interactions with nature and their mental health. The findings of the study were significant - individuals who spent more time in natural settings reported lower levels of anxiety, depression, and negative thinking. The study also suggested that even short visits, such as spending 20-30 minutes in a park, could have an immediate effect on an individual's mental health. This is because nature has a calming effect on the mind and helps to reduce the stress hormone cortisol which, in turn, reduces anxiety. The study also found that the benefits of spending time in nature were not limited to a single age group, gender, or occupation. It was found that individuals across different demographic categories experienced varying degrees of benefits from spending time in nature, meaning everyone can benefit from this natural form of therapy. The researchers suggest that doctors should consider prescribing time in nature as a form of therapy for patients dealing with anxiety and depression. This recommendation emphasizes the need for healthcare practitioners to explore alternative, natural solutions to treat mental health issues rather than relying solely on medication. People dealing with depression and anxiety can benefit from making nature a part of their daily routine, such as taking a walk in a nearby park or garden, visiting a forest or nature reserve or taking up gardening as a hobby. In conclusion, the study highlights the importance of nature in maintaining a healthy mind and encourages individuals to explore natural spaces as a way to combat mental health issues. Spending time in nature can be an effective, simple, and enjoyable solution to help mitigate symptoms of anxiety and depression that can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life."},{"prompt":"w do you solve a quadratic equation?

Decide what kind of treat you want to make, such as cookies or cake, and search for a recipe online or in a cookbook. When selecting a recipe, pay attention to the ingredients and the steps involved. Make sure you have all the ingredients and equipment needed before starting. Gather Ingredients Once you've chosen a recipe, gather all the ingredients and equipment you'll need. Double-check that you have everything, as missing an ingredient can compromise the finished product. Pre-measure ingredients, and group them together so that you can easily find what you need when you need it. Follow the Steps Follow each step in the recipe precisely. Many recipes require specific procedures, such as creaming butter or sifting flour, that are essential to the finished product. Don't take shortcuts, and don't be tempted to substitute ingredients, as that can affect the outcome. Bake for the Time Listed After preparing the ingredients, preheat your oven to the temperature listed in the recipe. Once the oven has reached the desired temperature, place the item in the oven and set a timer for the time listed in the recipe. Be sure to keep an eye on the item as it bakes to avoid overcooking. Test to See if It's Done At the end of the bake time, remove the item from the oven and test to see if it's done. Different treats require different tests, such as inserting a toothpick into a cake to see if it comes out clean or tapping on the top of a cookie to see if it's firm. If it's not done, put it back in the oven for a few minutes and test again. In conclusion, following a recipe is a crucial aspect of baking. By carefully choosing a recipe, gathering ingredients, following each step precisely, baking for the time specified, and testing to see if it's done, you'll be able to bake delicious treats that everyone will enjoy.

How can communities come together to support the rebuilding of the center?","completion":"Article: Communities Coming Together to Support the Rebuilding of a Burnt-Down Community Center A historic building that housed a community center has been reduced to ashes, leaving a devastating loss for the residents who relied on the resources and services offered by the center. From job training to free meals, the community center provided support and assistance to people of all ages. Losing it to a fire has left the community in dire need of resources to rebuild and recover. In the aftermath of the fire, the big question now is how communities can come together to support the rebuilding of the center. One way communities can support rebuilding efforts is through fundraising. Fundraising campaigns aimed at raising money to rebuild the center can be launched by individuals or community groups. The campaign can be advertised on social media or word of mouth can spread the message throughout the community. The community may also be eligible for government assistance or grants for rebuilding the center. Another important way of supporting the rebuilding efforts is by volunteering time and skills towards reconstruction activities. Volunteers can assist in the clean-up efforts or in the actual construction of the center. They can offer skills such as carpentry, electrical work, and plumbing, among others. Other volunteers can offer their time to organize fundraising campaigns and events. In addition, communities can offer resources such as land, building materials, and tools to support the rebuilding efforts. If an organization has vacant land that can be used for the reconstruction efforts, they can make it available for the center to avoid land acquisition costs. The community can also donate building materials like bricks and timber, as well as tools like excavators and bulldozers that are necessary for the reconstruction process. The good news is that once the center has been rebuilt, the community can align with the organization to work on sustainability efforts. This may include organizing programs and partnerships for fundraising, scholarship programs, or even environmental conservation initiatives. The loss of the community center was devastating; however, communities can come together to rebuild a better center that can help the community in more ways than before the fire. By supporting the rebuilding efforts through fundraising, volunteering, and resource donation, the community can come back stronger than ever before."},{"prompt":"A man is playing a guitar on the street corner.

Democrats were more likely than Republicans to prioritize environmental issues in their voting decisions. Younger generations were also more likely to prioritize environmental issues than older generations. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"According to a recent survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 80% of Americans prioritize environmental issues in their political decision-making. The survey, which had a large sample size of 10,417 adults, found that climate change and protecting air and water quality were among the top environmental concerns for Americans. It was also found that Democrats were more likely than Republicans to prioritize environmental issues in their voting decisions. This highlights a clear divide in the priorities of the two major political parties in the United States. While Democrats tend to advocate for stronger environmental protections, Republicans have historically been more skeptical of government intervention in environmental issues. Another interesting finding from the survey was that younger generations were more likely to prioritize environmental issues than older generations. This is particularly noteworthy as it suggests that in the coming years, there may be even greater demand for policies that address environmental concerns. Overall, this survey highlights the strong impact that environmental issues have on the political landscape of the United States. With a large majority of Americans prioritizing environmental issues in their decision-making, politicians from both parties would be wise to recognize and address these concerns if they hope to remain relevant to American voters. Given the growing concern over climate change and other environmental issues, it is likely that the demand for strong environmental policies will only continue to increase in the years to come."},{"prompt":"Generate a tweet that has the following sentiment: positive","completion":"\\"Feeling incredibly grateful for the people in my life who always support and uplift me.

You can also reduce your expenses by cutting back on non-essential items such as dining out, cable TV, or costly subscriptions. You can consider buying generic items instead of branded ones, buying in bulk, using coupons, and shopping during sales. Reducing your energy usage by turning off lights and unplugging electronics when not in use can also help to save on your utility bills. To manage your money more effectively, you should also consider setting financial goals. This means understanding what you want to achieve with your money, whether it is paying off debt, building an emergency fund, or saving for retirement. You can also consider automating your savings by having a certain amount of money automatically deposited into a savings account each month. Common mistakes when trying to save money include not being realistic about your goals or not starting with a clear plan.

This is especially important in our neighborhood where we have an increasing number of cyclists, and busy intersections with heavy traffic.
