Although the exact precontact population of the Americas is unknown, scholars estimate that Native American populations diminished by between 80 and 90% within the first centuries of contact with Europeans. The leading cause was disease. The continent was ravaged by epidemics of diseases such as smallpox, measles, and cholera, which were brought from Europe by the early explorers and spread quickly into new areas even before later explorers and colonists reached them. Native Americans suffered high mortality rates due to their lack of prior exposure to these diseases. The loss of lives was exacerbated by conflict between colonists and indigenous people. Colonists also frequently perpetrated massacres on the indigenous groups and enslaved them. According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), the North American Indian Wars of the 19th century cost the lives of about 19,000 whites and 30,000 Native Americans.

Malaysia delivered a preliminary report to the U.N. but did not release it publicly.","completion":"The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 continues to yield little progress. The Bluefin-21, an underwater drone, has combed 95% of the designated search area, but no significant findings have been made. This comes as a disappointment to families of the passengers, who have been anxiously awaiting any news about their loved ones. Adding to the frustration is the accusation made by the passenger's partner, who is pointing the finger at Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, claiming that he is deflecting the blame for the plane's disappearance. In response, the Prime Minister has asked the investigation team to see what additional information can be released. This move is likely an attempt to alleviate the growing criticism of the government's handling of the situation. In a separate development, Malaysia reportedly delivered a preliminary report to the United Nations, but chose not to make it public. This has raised questions about the transparency and openness of the investigation process. As the search for MH370 enters its third month, families of the passengers are becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress and the perceived lack of transparency from the Malaysian government. While the search continues, it is clear that the families will not rest until they have answers about what happened to their loved ones on that fateful flight."},{"prompt":"Write an article based on this Come out to your parents according to the plan that you created.

By the start of the Devonian period (416 Ma), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. Sand and silts were laid down in what is now the Ellsworth, Horlick and Pensacola Mountains. Glaciation began at the end of the Devonian period (360 Ma), as Gondwana became centered on the South Pole and the climate cooled, though flora remained. During the Permian period, the land became dominated by seed plants such as Glossopteris, a pteridosperm which grew in swamps.

Learn from an example.","completion":"Mastering the game of Mastermind requires a combination of logic, deduction, and a bit of luck. One important strategy is to eliminate two colors at the same time, which can be done by analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses. When faced with four unknown pins and the goal of eliminating two colors, a good tactic is to focus on pairs of pins that could potentially be the same, such as two reds or two blues. By making a guess that includes those pairs and receiving feedback, you can start to narrow down the possibilities and eliminate two colors at once. If you're trying to find the location of a red pin but don't know which hole it should be in, a good approach is to make a guess that includes at least one red pin in each hole. This will help you determine if there's only one red pin in the code, or if there are multiples. Eliminating two colors with only three unknown pins requires a bit of guesswork and intuition, but can be done by keeping track of the colors that have been eliminated in previous guesses. By making educated guesses and analyzing the feedback, you can work towards narrowing down the code. When you only have one or two unknown pins left, it's important to make smart, strategic guesses based on the information you have. Keep track of the colors that have been eliminated and make educated guesses based on the remaining possibilities. One helpful way to improve your Mastermind skills is to study examples of successful games. Pay attention to the way the player makes guesses and eliminates colors, and try to apply those same strategies to your own game.

It tells stories of people who were guided by their faith and believed in divine intervention in history, rather than just through human actions. Moreover, the Bible has been used as a historical reference by scholars for centuries. Archaeologists have found evidence that confirms many of the events recorded in the Bible, including the existence of kings and conflicts with other nations. Many historical events that were recorded in the Bible have been corroborated by secular sources such as the writings of the ancient Greeks and Romans, providing additional evidence of the Bible's historical accuracy.

This is an important metric as it provides a clear picture of the offensive capabilities of the team and how successful they were at gaining yards and scoring points. To determine the total number of yards scored on all touchdown passes, we need to add up the distance of each pass that resulted in a touchdown. This can be a lengthy and sometimes tedious process, as it involves going through each game and tracking each touchdown pass. Fortunately, many football websites and sports channels keep track of this statistic and make it readily available. For example, during the 2020 NFL season, a total of 1,146 touchdown passes were thrown. The combined total yardage of these passes was 11,471 yards. To put this into perspective, this means that on average, each touchdown pass resulted in a gain of 10.0 yards. Of course, this number can vary widely depending on the style of offense and the skill level of the quarterback and receivers. It's worth noting that the total yardage gained on touchdown passes is just one aspect of a team's offensive performance. There are many other factors that need to be considered, such as the success rate of third-down conversions, total rushing yards, and time of possession. In conclusion, the total number of yards scored on all touchdown passes combined is an important statistic that provides valuable insight into a team's offensive capabilities. While it's just one part of a larger picture, it's a crucial metric that is closely followed and analyzed by football fans worldwide."},{"prompt":"– And the plot thickens: A woman has been arrested after green paint was found splattered around the Washington National Cathedral today.

In 1951, the Air Force began a new ICBM program called MX1593, and by 1955 this program was receiving toppriority funding. The MX1593 program evolved to become the AtlasA, with its maiden launch occurring June 11, 1957, becoming the first successful American ICBM.

This decision comes after a crisis that has plunged the poverty-stricken nation into turmoil. Under the Madagascar constitution, Rajoelina is too young to become president. However, this did not stop the military from transferring power to him. The crisis erupted when thousands of people took to the streets to protest rising food prices. Madagascar, an island nation off the coast of East Africa, has struggled with poverty and underdevelopment for decades. The protests quickly turned into a broader movement against the government, which many felt was corrupt and ineffectual. As the crisis deepened, the military stepped in and removed then-president Marc Ravalomanana from power. Rajoelina, who had been serving as mayor of the capital city of Antananarivo, emerged as a prominent opposition leader and was seen by many as an alternative to the old political guard. However, there are concerns about Rajoelina's ability to govern effectively. At just 44 years old, he lacks the experience and gravitas of a more seasoned politician. Additionally, his youth means that he is ineligible to serve as president under the constitution. Despite these challenges, Rajoelina has promised to work tirelessly to address the issues facing Madagascar. He has vowed to tackle corruption, improve the economy, and build a brighter future for all Malagasy people. It remains to be seen whether Rajoelina can deliver on these promises, but for now, he has the support of the military and a significant portion of the population.

Unfortunately, it was. The story itself is mindlessly simple. Ethel, a homicidal maniac with an eating disorder, is released into a halfway house because of hospital overcrowding. She is by far the most sane resident watching while one man puts dead flies into another's soup. Ethel is then teased by one of the halfway house employees with a chocolate bar after he hits on the cost cutting measure of feeding the residents dog food. Ethel retaliates by strangling him with a wire noose on the stairs and then....well, you get the idea. If this all sounds like fun, it isn't. This film was poorly made with cheap effects and even worse acting. The characters are so wooden when delivering their lines that they should be standing out in front of a cigar store. To make matters worse, half of the film consists of flashbacks to the first Ethel movie, Criminally Insane, which is little better. A VERY poor effort.

In contrast, there have been long and protracted sieges that lasted months or even years, such as the Siege of Constantinople in 1453 or the Siege of Leningrad during World War II. In conclusion, the length of time it takes for a town to surrender is dependent on a multitude of factors and cannot be answered definitively without further information."},{"prompt":"Context:The computer , forex , was on an extremely non ergonomic desk ( I use that term loosely ) .

(2004, 2007), the Somalis are paternally closely related to other AfroAsiaticspeaking groups in Northeast Africa. Besides comprising the majority of the YDNA in Somalis, the E1b1b1a (formerly E3b1a) haplogroup also makes up a significant proportion of the paternal DNA of Ethiopians, Sudanese, Egyptians, Berbers, North African Arabs, as well as many Mediterranean populations. Sanchez et al. (2005) observed the M78 subclade of E1b1b in about 77% of their Somali male samples. According to Cruciani et al. (2007), the presence of this subhaplogroup in the Horn region may represent the traces of an ancient migration from Egypt/Libya. After haplogroup E1b1b, the second most frequently occurring YDNA haplogroup among Somalis is the West Asian haplogroup T (M70). It is observed in slightly more than 10% of Somali males. Haplogroup T, like haplogroup E1b1b, is also typically found among populations of Northeast Africa, North Africa, the Near East and the Mediterranean.

Many factors such as the size of the officer group, the intensity of the battle, and the tactics used can greatly affect the casualties. However, it is known that in some of the bloodiest battles in history, entire officer groups were wiped out along with their troops. For example, during the battle of Stalingrad in World War II, many German officer groups sustained heavy losses, with some being completely annihilated. Similarly, in the Battle of the Somme during World War I, British officer groups suffered significant casualties, with some being nearly decimated. It should be noted that casualties among officers were often much higher than the overall casualty rate, as they were often targeted by the enemy due to their leadership roles. Additionally, the loss of officers can severely disrupt the chain of command and hinder the ability of troops to carry out orders effectively. In conclusion, while the exact number of officer groups that saw over half of their soldiers killed cannot be determined, it is clear that casualties among officers were significant in many wars throughout history. The sacrifice and bravery of these soldiers, who led their troops into battle despite the dangers they faced, should be remembered and honored."},{"prompt":"Read this: The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) recognizes that conflicts may exist between the respect for and implementation of current intellectual property systems and other human rights. In 2001 the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights issued a document called Human rights and intellectual property that argued that intellectual property tends to be governed by economic goals when it should be viewed primarily as a social product; in order to serve human wellbeing, intellectual property systems must respect and conform to human rights laws. According to the Committee, when systems fail to do so they risk infringing upon the human right to food and health, and to cultural participation and scientific benefits. In 2004 the General Assembly of WIPO adopted The Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization which argues that WIPO should focus more on the needs of developing countries, and to view IP as one of many tools for development—not as an end in itself.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. Beer is the world's most widely consumed and likely the oldest alcoholic beverage; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grains—most commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect which is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and The Hymn to Ninkasi, a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.

To achieve the perfect balance of flavors, it is important to measure your ingredients accurately. However, this can be a challenge when using liquor bottles for free pouring.

Robbins pleaded guilty to stalking an ex-partner and her son, and could face up to three years in prison. The court heard how he had threatened to kill his former partner, and had demanded money back after having paid for her boob job. It's always shocking to see someone we admire fall from grace, and Robbins' case is no exception. His work as the voice of Charlie Brown helped to define an entire era of American pop culture, and has left an indelible mark on generations of viewers. However, it's important to remember that celebrities are people too, and that they are just as capable of making mistakes and exhibiting bad behavior as anyone else. It's also important to acknowledge the seriousness of Robbins' crimes. Stalking and making threats of violence are behaviors that can have incredibly harmful effects on their targets, and can leave victims feeling unsafe and traumatized. It's heartening to see the legal system take these crimes seriously, and to know that justice may be served in this case. Ultimately, it's up to each individual to decide how they want to approach Robbins' legacy in light of these recent events. Some may choose to separate the man from his iconic work as Charlie Brown's voice, while others may find it more difficult to reconcile the two. Regardless, it's clear that Robbins' actions have had a profound impact on the lives of those around him, and that he will be held accountable for his crimes under the law."},{"prompt":"Avicenna: In modern Iran, he is considered a national icon, and is often regarded as one of the greatest Persians to have ever lived.

Amend the soil Set the division in the hole and fill it in with soil. Water the plants as soon as the hole is filled in.","completion":"When it comes to planting a new tree or shrub, it's important to ensure that it has the right conditions to establish itself and thrive. One of the most critical factors is the quality of the soil in which it's planted. To give your new plant the best chance of success, it's essential to follow a few key steps. Firstly, once you have selected the location for your new plant, it's time to prepare the soil. Start by digging a hole that's 2–3 inches wider than the root ball. This extra space will give the roots room to stretch out and establish themselves more easily. Once you've dug the hole, it's time to amend the soil. Adding compost or other organic matter to the soil can help to improve its structure and nutrient content. This is especially important if you have heavy clay soil or sandy soil that drains too quickly. Mix in a generous amount of compost, manure, or other organic matter to create a loose, crumbly texture that will allow water and nutrients to circulate freely. Next, it's time to plant the new division. Set the plant in the hole so that the root ball is level with the surrounding soil. Take care not to bury the plant too deeply, as this can cause water to pool around the roots and lead to root rot or other problems. Once you have positioned the plant, fill in the hole with soil and gently pat it down to ensure good contact between the roots and the soil. Finally, it's important to give your new plant a good watering as soon as it's planted. This will help to settle the soil around the roots and provide the plant with the moisture it needs to start growing. Depending on the size of the plant and the weather conditions, you may need to water it again in a few days or weeks to ensure it stays hydrated and healthy. By following these simple steps, you can give your new tree or shrub the best chance of thriving in its new home. With proper soil preparation, planting techniques, and ongoing care, you can enjoy healthy, beautiful plants that will enhance your landscape for years to come."},{"prompt":"This is an email Jennifer, Phillip Allen and Keith Holst indicated that the curve changes in question for Socal was simply due to a higher forward market.

The charge is in relation to the sexual assault of a child, a first-degree felony. In addition to this latest charge, five of his followers are also facing charges. These charges range from assault to failing to report child abuse. Prosecutors allege that Jeffs married underage girls and had intimate relationships with them. This is not the first time that Jeffs has been in legal trouble. In 2011, he was sentenced to life in prison for sexually assaulting two minors. Despite the charges against him, Jeffs still has loyal followers within the church. They believe that Jeffs is a prophet and that the charges against him are part of a larger conspiracy to undermine their church. However, Jeffs' actions have been widely condemned by many outside the church, who see his actions as a clear case of child sexual abuse. The new charge against Jeffs and the charges against his followers serve as a reminder of the need to protect children from abuse and hold accountable those who would harm them.

According to historical records, the US population was estimated to be around 3.9 million in 1790, shortly after the country gained its independence. By 1810, the population had grown to around 7.2 million people, representing an increase of over 80%. To determine how many fewer people the US had in 1790 versus 1810, we can subtract the population figures for the two years. Therefore, to find the difference, we can subtract 3.9 million from 7.2 million, which gives us 3.3 million. This means that the US had 3.3 million fewer people in 1790 compared to 1810. It is worth noting that this rapid population growth was largely due to high birth rates and immigration. In the early years of the 19th century, the US experienced a surge of immigration, particularly from Europe, which contributed significantly to the growth of the population. In conclusion, the US population grew rapidly between 1790 and 1810, increasing by over 80%. As of 1790, the US had an estimated population of 3.9 million people, while by 1810, the population had grown to approximately 7.2 million, meaning that the US had 3.3 million fewer people in 1790 versus 1810."},{"prompt":"Select the topic that this about: The Bush administration dramatically escalated a dispute with the European Union yesterday by filing one of the biggest complaints in World Trade Organization history, accusing European governments OPTIONS: World Sports Business Science/Tech","completion":"Business."},{"prompt":"ere is a premise: and i had this really nice place you had to uh drive in as far as i could and then park and then you had to walk in the rest of the way Here is a hypothesis: You could not drive all the way to the end.

Following a sales peak in the early 1950s, the content of comic books (particularly crime and horror) was subjected to scrutiny from parent groups and government agencies, which culminated in Senate hearings that led to the establishment of the Comics Code Authority selfcensoring body. The Code has been blamed for stunting the growth of American comics and maintaining its low status in American society for much of the remainder of the century. Superheroes reestablished themselves as the most prominent comic book genre by the early 1960s. Underground comix challenged the Code and readers with adult, countercultural content in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Different fields of science use the term matter in different, and sometimes incompatible, ways. Some of these ways are based on loose historical meanings, from a time when there was no reason to distinguish mass and matter. As such, there is no single universally agreed scientific meaning of the word matter. Scientifically, the term mass is welldefined, but matter is not. Sometimes in the field of physics matter is simply equated with particles that exhibit rest mass (i.e., that cannot travel at the speed of light), such as quarks and leptons.

Some 11,800 British Empire soldiers, most of them Indians, became prisoners after the Siege of Kut in Mesopotamia in April 1916; 4,250 died in captivity. Although many were in a poor condition when captured, Ottoman officers forced them to march 1,100 kilometres to Anatolia. A survivor said: We were driven along like beasts; to drop out was to die. The survivors were then forced to build a railway through the Taurus Mountains. In Russia, when the prisoners from the Czech Legion of the AustroHungarian army were released in 1917, they rearmed themselves and briefly became a military and diplomatic force during the Russian Civil War.

The 63-year-old Mr Hill, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, had forgotten to pay the £2,000 outstanding rent, but immediately paid up after being served with the notice. Despite settling the debt, the couple was told that their tenancy had been terminated by the estate anyway. This news came as a shock to the couple who had dedicated their lives to serve and maintain the historic property. Chatsworth House, located in Derbyshire, England is a popular tourist attraction and is also used as a filming location for several movies and TV shows. The Hills' departure has sparked outrage among supporters who have launched a petition to reinstate the couple back into their jobs. The petition, which has garnered over 10,000 signatures so far, argues that the couple's contribution to Chatsworth House goes beyond their role as caretakers. They have provided a warm welcome to visitors and have ensured that the property is well-maintained and protected. The estate, which is owned by the Duke of Devonshire, has issued a statement saying that they had to terminate the Hills' tenancy due to their \\"failure to adhere to the terms of their lease.\\" However, the statement did acknowledge that the couple had provided \\"exceptional service\\" over the years. The Hills' case highlights the challenges faced by caretakers and estate workers who live on-site. The nature of their employment means that they often have to rely on their employer's goodwill to keep their jobs and homes. As the petition gains momentum, it remains to be seen if the Hills will be reinstated. However, their story has sparked a conversation around the importance of recognizing the contributions of caretakers and estate workers, and the need for better protections for people in these roles."},{"prompt":"efte: advanced lightweight configurable editor (package info), orphaned since 1541 days.

The play was executed by Bears running back, Bob Gage, who took a handoff from the quarterback and ran 97 yards for a touchdown. This record-breaking play still stands today and is unlikely to be surpassed anytime soon. Since the early days of professional football, there have been many talented running backs who have made impressive long runs. However, none have been able to surpass Gage's impressive 97-yard rush. The closest any player has come to this record was in 2003, when Baltimore Ravens running back Jamal Lewis ran for a 94-yard touchdown against the Cleveland Browns. It is important to note that while the 97-yard run is the longest in NFL history, it is not the longest in football history overall. The longest run in football history occurred during a college game between Ole Miss and Arkansas in 1934, when a player named Tom Harmon ran 96 yards for a touchdown. Overall, the 97-yard rushing play by Bob Gage is an impressive feat that has stood the test of time.

Point the laser or sensor towards the object. Press the button on the thermometer. Avoid measuring shiny or reflective objects. Use a special infrared thermometer for ears.","completion":"Using a thermometer to measure temperature is a simple yet effective way to monitor changes in body temperature or temperature of an object. However, it is important to know where to hold the thermometer and how to use it correctly to get accurate readings. One of the most important things to consider when taking a temperature reading is the distance-to-spot ratio. This means that the further away you are from the object you are trying to measure, the larger the area your thermometer can measure, and vice versa. It is therefore recommended to hold the thermometer as close to the object as possible, while still being able to maintain the recommended distance-to-spot ratio. When taking a temperature reading, it is important to ensure that the thermometer is pointed towards the object that you are measuring. Many thermometers are equipped with a laser or sensor that helps you to determine where to point the thermometer. This helps to ensure that you are measuring the correct location on the object, and that you'll get a precise and accurate reading. It is also important to avoid measuring shiny or reflective objects, such as polished metal or glass. These surfaces can reflect the infrared light which the thermometer uses to measure temperature, which can result in inaccurate readings. To avoid this, try covering the shiny or reflective area with something non-reflective, such as a piece of paper or cloth. When taking a temperature reading from the ear, it is recommended to use a special infrared thermometer designed for this purpose. These thermometers have a specially designed sensor that allows you to measure the temperature of the ear canal more easily and accurately. In conclusion, taking accurate temperature readings can be done easily and efficiently when using a thermometer correctly. It is important to consider the distance-to-spot ratio, point the thermometer towards the object being measured, avoid measuring shiny or reflective objects, and use a special infrared thermometer when measuring the ear canal. By adhering to these guidelines, you'll be able to get accurate temperature readings every time."},{"prompt":"sharp and quick How would the sentiment of this sentence be perceived?

The National Conference of State Legislatures held in Washington D.C. stated in a 2014 overview that many supporters for affirmative action argue that policies stemming from affirmative action help to open doors for historically excluded groups in workplace settings and higher education. Workplace diversity has become a business management concept in which employers actively seek to promote an inclusive workplace. By valuing diversity, employers have the capacity to create an environment in which there is a culture of respect for individual differences as well as the ability to draw in talent and ideas from all segments of the population.

According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, many private sector employers have concluded that a diverse workforce makes a company stronger, more profitable, and a better place to work.
