On Tuesday, Canadian authorities said DNA tied an American man to her death. The man, Bobby Jack Fowler, died in a U.S. prison in 2006. But he remains a person of interest in 9 cases of missing or murdered Canadian women.","completion":"The year was 1974, when 16-year-old Colleen MacMillen was found murdered in British Columbia, Canada. The search for her killer has been going on for more than four decades now, with authorities continuously trying to find the culprit. On Tuesday, there was some significant progress in the case as forensic evidence and DNA testing tied an American man named Bobby Jack Fowler to her death. Fowler was already in prison in the United States when the Canadian authorities made the connection. He died in prison in 2006, but his name remains among the \\"persons of interest\\" in as many as nine cases relating to missing or murdered Canadian women. The development of linking Fowler to MacMillen's case was an outcome of advanced forensic technology that was not available back in 1974. From a microscopic sample of skin cells, scientists were able to create a DNA profile of the killer which later connected Fowler's DNA to the crime scene. The whole process of DNA testing has been revolutionary in providing answers to long-standing questions in several cases. The fact that Fowler is already dead complicates the process of obtaining justice for the victims, but it gives the families of those affected some closure after years of waiting for answers. Fowler may not have been able to answer for his crimes, but the progression of technology has allowed authorities to connect the dots and give justice to those who have suffered. The link between Fowler's DNA and nine other cases highlighting missing or murdered women in Canada is an ongoing investigation. It raises questions about how many women may have been put to rest without justice due to the lack of forensic technology back in the day. However, this latest development should allow Canadian authorities to revisit other cases with a newfound energy, and hopefully provide justice to the other families waiting for answers. In conclusion, the connection of Bobby Jack Fowler to Colleen MacMillen's murder is a significant breakthrough in the long journey of providing justice to victims of crime. The power of forensics and DNA testing is remarkable and provides a beacon of hope to families of unsolved cases everywhere. Although Fowler is no longer alive, this proves that no stone should be left unturned when it comes to finding answers for those who have been impacted by crimes."},{"prompt":"Write a dialog with this premise Frank doesn't know what to buy Marie for her 18th birthday.

Prepare the elk steaks. Trim your elk steaks, if necessary, and dry them with paper towels. Season them generously with salt and black pepper. 3. Sear the elk steaks. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat until it's hot. Add the elk steaks and sear them for 3 minutes on one side. Flip them over and transfer the skillet to the preheated oven. 4. Bake the elk steaks. Once the skillet is in the oven, bake the elk steaks for approximately 10 minutes. The exact cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of your steaks and your desired level of doneness. 5. Rest the elk steaks. When the elk steaks are done cooking, remove them from the oven and let them rest for 5 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat and ensures that the steaks are juicy and tender. 6. Make the pan sauce. While the elk steaks are resting, pour beef stock into the skillet and deglaze the pan. Bring the stock to a boil and reduce it by half. Stir in Worcestershire sauce, minced garlic, and butter until everything is well combined. 7. Serve the elk steaks with the pan sauce. Spoon the pan sauce over the elk steaks and serve them immediately. This pan sauce is so flavorful that it can easily stand on its own, but you can also serve it with a side of your favorite vegetables or a baked potato. Enjoy your delicious and impressive elk steaks with an easy pan sauce!"},{"prompt":"Concepts: crowd, meet, politician, supporter Write a sentence that includes all these words.","completion":"The politician was greeted by a large crowd of supporters at the meet."},{"prompt":"What are the most important words in the following sentence: people waiting for a metro in a statio","completion":"people, waiting, metro, station"},{"prompt":"Theft by finding occurs when someone chances upon an object which seems abandoned and takes possession of the object but fails to take steps to establish whether the object is genuinely abandoned and not merely lost or unattended.

The film is beautifully photographed and powerfully acted. The youngster portraying 'Frits' the lead character has an astonishingly open face which mirrors with painful accuracy the tragic events which unfold around him. Early on in the film we see that the father whom Frits loves so much has mental health problems and this is brought up when the brutal headmaster denies assaulting the boy and suggests it was his own father. The climactic scene where Frits refuses to show any respect to the headmaster; simply standing his ground and repeating 'Liar' as he is brutally assaulted in front of his classmates is a scene you are not likely to forget.

To address this issue, the forum is calling for regular monitoring of adults' weights, with children weighed annually.

The forum suggests that regular monitoring and annual weigh-ins could help individuals recognize and address weight gain before it becomes a more significant health issue. While some may argue that monitoring and weighing could be seen as intrusive or overly judgmental, the forum argues that the potential costs of not addressing the obesity crisis are far greater. By proactively managing weight and health, individuals may be able to avoid costly and disruptive medical interventions down the line. Ultimately, the obesity crisis is everyone's problem.

If you’re struggling to quit biting your nails, here are a few tips to help you find a habit to take its place. First, distract your hands by taking up a hobby. Do you enjoy drawing, knitting, or playing an instrument? Find an activity that requires the use of your hands, so you’re not tempted to bite your nails. When you’re keeping your hands busy, you’re less likely to think about biting your nails. In addition to keeping your hands busy, it’s also helpful to keep your mouth busy. Chew gum or suck on a mint to satisfy your oral fixation. You can also drink water or tea to keep your mouth occupied. This will make it more difficult to bite your nails. Another solution is to wear nail polish. Paint your nails a bright color that you love or get a manicure. You’ll be less likely to ruin your pretty nails by biting them. Plus, the taste of nail polish can deter you from biting your nails. In conclusion, replacing a habit like nail biting is possible with a little effort and creativity. By keeping your hands and mouth busy or wearing nail polish, you can kick the habit for good.

Kids become dentists, radio presenters and firemen to earn money to spend.","completion":"Kidzania: The Ultimate Learning Experience for Kids West London is set to welcome a new exciting addition to its landscape in the form of a sprawling 75,000 sq ft fake town called Kidzania. It is an innovative concept that aims to bridge the gap between education, entertainment, and real-life experiences for children aged four to 12 years. At Kidzania, kids get to don the roles of radio presenters, dentists, firefighters, doctors, and more, giving them a chance to experience different professions and learn valuable life skills in a fun and interactive way. The best part is that they get to earn 'Kidzos,' the official currency of Kidzania, which can be spent on a range of goods and services within the city. The concept behind Kidzania is to promote financial literacy and develop essential life skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving in children. With a range of activities and scenarios based on real-life situations, Kidzania provides a holistic learning experience that prepares kids for their future careers. The idea of a fake town might seem childish, but Kidzania has been designed by experts to deliver maximum impact. The city features a range of realistic activities, such as driving a car, flying an airplane, or performing surgery, giving youngsters a chance to experience adult life within a controlled environment. A visit to Kidzania is not only an engaging experience for kids, but it is also a great opportunity for parents to understand the aspirations and career interests of their children. Kidzania provides insights into the psychographics of kids, helping parents align their children's career interests with the real world. The project is a joint venture between a UK property company and Kidzania's Mexican creators, who already run successful Kidzania locations around the world. The fake town is set to open in 2022, and it is expected to become a popular tourist attraction and an exciting learning hub for children. In conclusion, Kidzania is much more than just a fun-filled destination for kids – it is an educational experience designed to shape and mould the career aspirations of our future workforce. By providing kids with the opportunity to explore and experience different professions, Kidzania is working towards a future where children are empowered to make informed career choices and contribute to society in a meaningful way."},{"prompt":"Write a negative movie review.","completion":"The movie lacked depth in its characters and the storyline was predictable.

Soon, Holy Roman Imperial forces joined the battle and conquered the members of the Schmalkaldic League, oppressing and exiling many German Lutherans as they enforced the terms of the Augsburg Interim. Religious freedom was secured for Lutherans through the Peace of Passau in 1552, and under the Cuius regio, eius religio and Declaratio Ferdinandei clauses of the Peace of Augsburg in 1555. Religious disputes between the CryptoCalvinists, Philippists, Sacramentarians, Ubiquitarians and GnesioLutherans raged within Lutheranism during the middle of the 16th century.

The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) confirmed that the base lost power in \\"extremely difficult conditions,\\" causing the temperature inside to drop almost to freezing levels.

However, when it comes to comparing the population size of these two animals, which one has a higher number? According to statistics from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, as of 2020, the global population of cattle was estimated to be around 1.5 billion. In comparison, the global population of pigs was around 770 million. This means that there are currently more cattle than swine worldwide. One of the reasons why cattle outnumber pigs is that they have been domesticated for a more extended period. Humans have been raising cattle for thousands of years, mainly for meat, milk, and leather. On the other hand, pig farming began relatively recently, with the first known domestication occurring around 7,000 to 8,000 years ago. Another reason for the difference in population size is that cattle are more widely distributed around the world than pigs. Cattle farming is prevalent in many countries, including Brazil, India, China, and the United States. In contrast, pig farming is more concentrated in certain regions, such as Europe and Asia. In conclusion, while both cattle and swine are significant livestock animals, there are currently more cattle than swine worldwide. However, the populations of both animals continue to grow, driven by the increasing demand for meat and dairy products."},{"prompt":"Generate a sentence that includes all the following words: evening, lion, re","completion":"The lion rested in the evening."},{"prompt":"What is the sentiment of the following review?

This number will be significant to your analysis of your future relationship or love life. To perform this ritual, you need to begin by spelling out the word \\"FLAME\\" by counting out the letters one by one. Once you have done that, note down the letter that you end with. This letter is the starting point of your analysis. Next, add up the remaining letters in your alphabet, which will be different for everyone, depending on their language and script.

Once you have your leftover letters, analyze their significance based on your letter of conclusion. Each letter corresponds to a certain aspect of your life, and its position in relation to your starting letter can tell you a great deal about your future.

If your ending letter is \\"M\\" and you have 12 leftover letters, you might find yourself drawn to creative endeavors and unconventional relationships.

Sadly, the building has become an infamous symbol of the city's decay in recent years.

The history of the Packard Automotive Plant will always be a defining element of Detroit's past. However, the future of the building is still up for debate.

The settlement has been left to crumble due to government neglect, a drop in tourism and security issues. Experts believe the site may have completely disappeared within 20 years.","completion":"The ancient ruins of Mohenjodaro, an important archaeological site in southern Pakistan, paint a fascinating picture of a civilization that thrived more than 5,000 years ago. However, the site has been in a state of decline due to a combination of government neglect, a drop in tourism, and security issues. Mohenjodaro was once a bustling city with a complex infrastructure that included a sophisticated drainage system and multi-story houses. But today, many of the city's buildings are crumbling and its streets are littered with debris. One major issue contributing to the decline of Mohenjodaro is government neglect. Despite being designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980, the government has failed to allocate sufficient funds for its preservation and upkeep. The site's curators have been forced to rely on external funding and donations, which have not been enough to keep up with the cost of maintaining the ruins. Another major issue facing Mohenjodaro is a drop in tourism. The site was once a popular destination for tourists, but violent incidents in the region in recent years have caused many visitors to stay away. This has had a devastating impact on the local economy, as many people depended on tourism for their livelihoods. Finally, security issues have also contributed to the decline of Mohenjodaro. The site is located near the border with India, which has led to tensions between the two countries. This has resulted in heightened security measures in the region, which can make it difficult for visitors to access the site. Experts warn that if nothing is done to address these issues, the site may completely disappear within the next 20 years. This would be a devastating loss for the people of Pakistan and for anyone interested in ancient history. In conclusion, it's imperative that the government takes action to address the issues facing Mohenjodaro. The site is a valuable part of Pakistan's cultural heritage and deserves to be preserved for future generations. By allocating more funding for its upkeep, promoting tourism, and addressing security concerns, we can ensure that this important archaeological site continues to stand the test of time."},{"prompt":"Add punctuation: We proudly offer BEST price guarantee to our Classic Design Dangle Style Pink Purple Faceted Austrian Crystal Drop Shape EarringsThis Classic Design Dangle Style Pink Purple Faceted Austrian Crystal Drop Shape Earrings is offered at the LOWEST price on the market with premium qualityNOW its best chance to make the discount Austrian crystal earrings deals with Bjbeadcom","completion":"We proudly offer BEST price guarantee to our Classic Design Dangle Style Pink Purple Faceted Austrian Crystal Drop Shape Earrings.

The church has been criticized for not acting ethically in this matter. Cardinal O'Brien resigned from his position in February 2013, following allegations of inappropriate conduct towards fellow priests. He denied the allegations but admitted that \\"there have been times that my sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest, archbishop, and cardinal.\\" The allegations made against Cardinal O'Brien have caused outrage among many Catholics and have raised questions about the church's handling of such cases. The unnamed former priest who accused the cardinal of inappropriate behavior has stated that the church did not act ethically in dealing with his case. Cardinal O'Brien was due to travel to Rome to help elect the successor to Pope Benedict XVI but has now withdrawn from the process. The election of a new pope is an important event for the Catholic Church and the withdrawal of Cardinal O'Brien will be seen as a significant blow. The allegations made against Cardinal O'Brien are a sobering reminder of the importance of addressing inappropriate behavior within the church.

Some people pay artists to paint their Facebook profile pictures and Twitter icons. Free Web sites generate cartoon pictures of people for use in social media. Researcher says portraits are necessary standins for people online. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"In the digital age, the portrait has taken on a whole new level of significance. While once reserved for the wealthy and powerful, portraits are now accessible to everyone thanks to the internet. One trend that has emerged in recent years is the commissioning of portraits for use as social media profile pictures. People are willing to pay artists to create unique and personalized portraits that they can use to represent themselves online. Even more accessible are the free web sites that generate cartoon portraits of people for use in social media. Why are portraits so important for people online? Researchers say that portraits serve as necessary stand-ins for people when they are communicating online. Unlike in-person interactions, where body language and non-verbal cues play a major role in communication, online communication relies solely on the written word and images. Portraits can convey much more than just a person's physical appearance. They can also communicate personality traits, interests, and values. A well-crafted portrait can reveal a lot about a person in a single glance, making it easier for others to connect with them online. However, the rise of digital portraits has also raised concerns about privacy and accuracy. With so much personal information available online, it can be easy for someone to create a digital portrait of another person without their consent. Additionally, digital portraits may not always accurately represent a person's physical appearance. Despite these concerns, the popularity of digital portraits shows no signs of slowing down. As more and more people turn to social media to connect with others, the need for personalized and distinctive portraits will only continue to grow. Whether hand-painted or generated by a computer, portraits offer a way for people to express themselves and connect with others online."},{"prompt":"ere is some data: Adrian Carriers Racing TRUCK(S) Chevrolet Silverado.

If you are experiencing a sore throat, headache, or fever, acetaminophen or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen can provide relief. These medications can also help reduce any inflammation in the body caused by the cold. Coughing and congestion are also common symptoms of a cold that can be relieved by taking antihistamines or decongestants. Antihistamines can help dry up excess mucus and relieve coughing, while decongestants work to reduce swelling in the nasal passages, making it easier to breathe. For those looking to boost their immune system and recover from the cold more quickly, vitamin C or echinacea supplements may be beneficial. Vitamin C is known to help support the immune system and can potentially reduce the duration of a cold if taken in large doses at the first sign of symptoms. Echinacea has also been shown to have immune-boosting properties that may help reduce the length and severity of a cold. It's important to note that while over-the-counter remedies can help alleviate cold symptoms, they should not replace proper rest and nutrition. Drinking plenty of fluids, getting adequate sleep, and eating a balanced diet are all important factors in maintaining a healthy immune system and recovering from a cold quickly.

By examining timeless tales that have captured audiences for generations, you can learn what makes a great story and apply those lessons to your own work.

This can be accomplished through color schemes, use of typography, or even experimentation with different mediums. Another effective tool for storytellers is to play with parody and pastiche. By drawing inspiration from existing works and giving them a fresh twist, you can create something that feels familiar yet wholly original. Of course, storytelling is also about being bold and extravagant. Don't be afraid to take risks, push boundaries, and create something truly unforgettable. But it's important to maintain a sense of purpose and focus as well. Keeping your work minimal and streamlined can help you hone in on the most important elements of your story and communicate them clearly to your audience.

Boil water in it after brushing if you’re concerned about germs. Dry the dutch oven thoroughly. Oil the surface lightly after each cleaning.","completion":"Cast iron cookware has been a favourite of home cooks for ages. It's reliable, durable, and versatile. However, cleaning cast iron cookware can be a bit of a challenge. This is especially true for the Dutch oven, which is larger and heavier than most cast iron pans. But fear not, with some simple tips, cleaning your Dutch oven can be a breeze. The first step to cleaning your Dutch oven is to wash it with hot water and a non-metal scrub brush. Metal scrub brushes can damage the seasoning of your Dutch oven, which can impact its non-stick quality over time. Use hot water to help loosen any debris or food particles that may be stuck to the surface of the Dutch oven. If you’re concerned about germs, you can boil water in the Dutch oven after brushing it. Boiling water can help kill any bacteria that may be present on the surface of your Dutch oven. Simply pour in enough water to cover the bottom of the Dutch oven and bring it to a boil. Let it boil for a few minutes before carefully pouring out the water. Once you’ve washed and boiled the Dutch oven, dry it thoroughly. Moisture is the enemy of cast iron cookware, so make sure there’s no moisture left on the surface. You can use a towel to dry the Dutch oven, but make sure it’s completely dry before moving on to the next step. The most important step in maintaining your Dutch oven’s non-stick quality is to oil the surface lightly after each cleaning. This helps to re-season the cast iron, keeping it in top-notch condition. You can use any food-safe oil, but many people prefer to use vegetable oil or flaxseed oil. Using a paper towel, coat the surface of the Dutch oven with a thin layer of oil. Make sure to cover the entire surface, including the sides and bottom. In conclusion, cleaning your Dutch oven can be easy and stress-free if you follow these simple steps. Wash it with hot water and a non-metal scrub brush, boil water in it after brushing if you’re concerned about germs, dry it thoroughly, and oil the surface lightly after each cleaning. With proper care and maintenance, your Dutch oven can last for generations."},{"prompt":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: The company has hired more men than women.

The ad was previously banned by city transit officials, but a federal judge overturned that decision last month. The group behind the ad, the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI), says that they are not concerned about inflaming Muslims. The ad displays an image of the World Trade Center in flames with the words “That’s his jihad. What’s yours?” written next to it. It also features a disclaimer that says, “This is not Islamophobia. This is Islamorealism.” Last year, the AFDI wanted to purchase ad space in New York subways for the same ad. However, city transit officials refused to display it, citing concerns that it could incite violence. The AFDI sued the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) in response, claiming that the denial of display violated their First Amendment rights. The MTA argued that the ad violated their advertising standards that prohibit displaying ads that demean a certain demographic or religion. However, the federal judge ruled that the ad is protected by the First Amendment, and that the MTA could not prohibit it from being displayed. The “Defeat Jihad” ad has been a source of controversy since its inception, with many Muslim groups and civil rights organizations calling it bigoted and hateful. However, the AFDI argues that they are simply exercising their right to free speech and standing up against what they see as a threat from Islamic extremism.

Tesco offer him a £5 voucher for his troubles at a Northumberland store.","completion":"In a recent incident at a Tesco store located in Northumberland, Chris McGarry was accused of theft despite having paid cash for his food moments earlier. This is not only embarrassing but also raises concerns about the level of communication within Tesco staff. It is understandable that Tesco staff need to be vigilant in preventing theft within their premises. However, accusing a customer who has already paid for their items is a customer service failure. Such incidents create a sense of mistrust between the customer and the retailer. It also causes embarrassment and discomfort to the customer. The fact that Chris McGarry was offered a £5 voucher for his troubles may seem like an attempt to smooth things over, but it does not fully address the magnitude of the mistake. Tesco should have taken this incident seriously by apologizing to Chris and reviewing their procedures to prevent future cases of this sort. Customers expect to be treated with respect and kindness when shopping at any retail store. They should not have to endure humiliation or face accusations of theft, especially when they have already paid for their items. Tesco should prioritize clear communication and training of their staff to avoid any incidents of this nature. In conclusion, while the £5 voucher offered to Chris McGarry may have served as some form of compensation, it is an inadequate response to the situation. Tesco should do better to prevent customer service errors that can create a sense of mistrust and embarrassment for the customer."},{"prompt":"1.

Agriculture and livestock production have been the traditional backbone of the country's economy, and farming continues to play a dominant role in the country's exports. However, over the past few years, the commerce sector has been growing steadily and has made significant contributions to the country's economy. According to a report by the World Bank, agriculture accounts for approximately 20% of Paraguay's GDP, while commerce contributes about 18%. Although agriculture is the larger sector, it is essential to note that commerce plays a vital role in supporting the country's agriculture industry. The commercial sector in Paraguay provides services such as financing, transportation, and marketing to the farming community, enabling farmers to focus on their core business of producing crops and livestock. Paraguay is one of the world's largest exporters of soybeans, beef, and maize. The country's agricultural exports account for approximately 85% of the country's total exports. The agricultural sector is dominated by small and medium-sized farms that produce a variety of crops, including soybeans, cotton, wheat, tobacco, and sugarcane.

Examples include nitroglycerin, nitrates, ACE inhibitors, terazosin (Hytrin), and hydralazine. Note that all of these substances lead to peripheral vasodilation.

The turtles, once prevalent from Canada down the Pacific coast to Mexico, have dwindled to record low levels.","completion":"A recent batch of Western Pond Turtles, little bigger than a coin, has hatched at Oregon Zoo, marking a significant milestone in the 20-year programme to save the severely endangered species. The Western Pond Turtles were once prevalent from Canada down the Pacific coast to Mexico, but their population has dwindled to record low levels. This news brings hope to conservationists who have been working tirelessly to protect this species. Conservationists have identified the primary causes of population decline: habitat loss, predation, and the introduction of invasive species. Fortunately, a combination of conservation efforts, such as habitat and predator management and reintroduction programmes, has spurred the growth of the Western Pond Turtle population. The breeding programme at the Oregon Zoo is an essential part of the effort to save the Western Pond Turtle. Since the programme's inception, over 150 turtles have been released into the wild. More than 80% of the turtles released through this programme have survived, which shows significant progress in helping this nearly extinct species to recover. The Oregon Zoo's breeding programme is one of the many concerted efforts among conservationists across the region to save the Western Pond Turtle from extinction. It is important to remember that although the programme's success is crucial, we must incorporate long-term solutions to sustain Western Pond Turtles' population growth. The rehabilitation efforts should go beyond releasing seed groups into the wild. It is vital to ensure that these turtles have suitable habitats and accessible food sources to survive and reproduce. The recent hatching of a new batch of Western Pond Turtles represents a promising step towards the recovery of the species. Nevertheless, there is still a long road ahead, but conservationists will continue to work hard to better these turtles' chances of survival. These little turtles represent hope and remind us of our duty to conserve the natural world around us."},{"prompt":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: Antwerp International Airport, operatingOrganisation, Flemish Government; Antwerp International Airport, owner, Flemish Region; Antwerp International Airport, runwayLength, 600.0","completion":"Antwerp International Airport, owned by the Flemish Region and operated by the operatingOrganisation appointed by the Flemish Government, boasts a runwayLength of 600.0 meters, making it an ideal destination for travelers seeking convenience and accessibility in the region."},{"prompt":"Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to cast metal Get a 2piece mold frame.

To ensure your salamander stays healthy, there are some simple steps you can take. First, quarantine any new animals before introducing them to your salamander. This can help prevent the spread of disease. Second, avoid handling salamanders as much as possible. They have delicate skin that can easily become damaged or irritated. Touching them too often can also cause undue stress. Third, when it’s time to transfer your salamander to a new habitat, be sure to do so carefully. Use a container to gently move it to its new home, rather than picking it up with your hands. Fourth, feeding your salamander is critical to its health. It’s best to feed them live food, such as crickets or worms. Make sure to feed them an appropriate amount, as overfeeding can lead to health problems. Fifth, clean the habitat regularly to prevent the buildup of waste and bacteria. Replace the water in their enclosure every few days. Finally, watch for eggs. Salamanders breed in the spring and summer, so keep an eye out for eggs in their habitat. If you find eggs, you can either leave them be or move them to a separate location. With these simple steps, you can help ensure that your pet salamander stays healthy and happy."},{"prompt":"President Bush defended his decision to invade Iraq, while John Kerry said that Mr. Bush lacked the record to justify reelection.

Gravedancers was better. I can only guess from watching this that the production must have been quite limited. I will admit the story started out interesting but really fizzled for me in the end. We weren't really given time to sympathize or understand any of the characters which only made each of their erratic characteristics even more annoying. I have to mention that there was also a bit of miscasting with a 12yearold boy acting as Sheriff. The only reason I sat through the whole film was to find out what the big secret was, which turned out to not be all that interesting.

Drax, a power plant in North Yorkshire, made the decision to switch from coal to biomass in an effort to reduce its carbon footprint. The British government even agreed to pay double for power generated through this eco-friendly method. However, the offer was withdrawn after it was revealed that the biomass pellets being used were being brought in from the United States, specifically from North Carolina, a journey of over 3,000 miles. It was later discovered that the carbon emissions resulting from the transportation of these pellets outweighed any reduction in emissions from the switch to biomass. This serves as a reminder that while renewable energy is an important step towards reducing carbon emissions, careful consideration must also be given to the entire process from start to finish. It is not enough to simply rely on renewable energy sources without considering the impact of their production, transport, and use. Drax’s intentions were commendable, but the outcome highlights the importance of sourcing biomass locally and sustainably. As the world continues to seek out more sustainable energy alternatives, it is vital that we remain vigilant and scrutinize every aspect of the process to ensure that we are truly making a positive impact on the environment."},{"prompt":"Paragraph: Sara wanted to play on a baseball team.

Choose a leaf near the top of the plant. Approach the leaf from the direction the hairs are growing. Pinch the leaf firmly.","completion":"Nettles are a common plant that can be found in forests and gardens. One of the most distinctive features of nettles is their stinging hairs. To understand how nettles sting, it is important to take a closer look at the plant. Choose a nettle plant growing in the shade, as stinging hairs are more prevalent in these areas. Look closely at the leaves and stems of the plant, and you can see the tiny hairs that give nettles their sting. If you want to get a firsthand experience of nettles' sting, choose a leaf near the top of the plant. Approach the leaf from the direction that the hairs are growing. This is important, as approaching the leaf from the opposite direction can cause the hairs to lie flat and reduce the chance of a sting. Pinch the leaf firmly between your fingers, and you should feel a sharp sting. The sting is caused by chemicals in the hairs that are released when they come into contact with skin. It is important to note that the sting of nettles is not dangerous, but it can be uncomfortable. Over time, the sting will typically subside on its own. This is due to the natural effects of the body's immune system. However, if you experience severe itching or swelling, you may want to seek medical attention. There are also a number of home remedies that can be used to relieve the symptoms of nettle stings. In conclusion, nettles are a fascinating plant with a unique sting. By following these simple steps, you can experience the sting of a nettle firsthand and gain a better understanding of how these plants work. Remember to approach nettles with caution, and avoid coming into contact with them if you have a known allergy."},{"prompt":"(1) The new album \`\` Deathstar Rising '' cracked the Finnish Album Top 10 and reached # 8 in first week of March 2011 .
