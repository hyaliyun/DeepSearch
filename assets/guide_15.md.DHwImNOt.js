Whether you’re trying to cool down a stuffy room or looking for a refreshing blast on a hot summer day, finding a cold air source can make all the difference. One simple way to access cold air is to utilize your home’s air conditioning system. If you have central air conditioning, adjust the thermostat to a cooler temperature and wait for the air to start flowing. If you don’t have central air, use a window-mounted air conditioning unit or a portable air conditioner. These devices can be very effective at cooling small spaces quickly. Another option for finding a cold air source is to seek out natural cold spots in your home. This can include a basement, a tiled bathroom or a room with large windows that face north. These areas tend to retain cooler temperatures, and can be a welcome refuge on hot days. You can also try opening windows during cooler parts of the day like early morning or late night to let in fresh cooler air. For outdoor relief, you can head to a shady area or look for a breeze to cool you down. If you’re near water, try dipping your feet in for an instant cooling effect. You can also invest in a personal fan or misting spray to create a cool, refreshing breeze. Remember, staying cool in hot weather is important for your health and comfort. Finding a cold air source is just one way to beat the heat and stay comfortable.

Bironas' average field goal distance is approximately 38 yards. So 239 field goals by 38 yards equals 9,082 total yards of field goals made by Bironas.

As American poet Kenneth Rexroth explains, Cubism in poetry is the conscious, deliberate dissociation and recombination of elements into a new artistic entity made selfsufficient by its rigorous architecture. This is quite different from the free association of the Surrealists and the combination of unconscious utterance and political nihilism of Dada. Nonetheless, the Cubist poets' influence on both Cubism and the later movements of Dada and Surrealism was profound; Louis Aragon, founding member of Surrealism, said that for Breton, Soupault, Éluard and himself, Reverdy was our immediate elder, the exemplary poet. Though not as well remembered as the Cubist painters, these poets continue to influence and inspire; American poets John Ashbery and Ron Padgett have recently produced new translations of Reverdy's work.

Depending on the league, there may have been different players who scored the last goals in these crucial matches. In the NHL, one of the most famous recent game 7s was the Stanley Cup Final in 2019 between the Boston Bruins and the St. Louis Blues. In that game, the last two regulation goals were scored by Blues forward Ryan O'Reilly and Bruins forward Jake DeBrusk. O'Reilly scored at the 10:38 mark of the third period to put the Blues up 3-0, while DeBrusk scored just over a minute later to cut the lead to 3-1. The game ultimately ended with a 4-1 victory for the Blues, securing their franchise's first Stanley Cup. In the NBA, one of the most memorable game 7s in recent history was the 2016 Finals between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors. In that game, the last two regulation goals were scored by Cavaliers forward Kyrie Irving and Warriors forward Andre Iguodala. Irving hit a clutch three-pointer with 0:53 remaining to give the Cavs a 92-89 lead, but Iguodala responded with a layup to cut the lead to 92-91 with 0:30 remaining. The game ultimately ended with a 93-89 victory for the Cavaliers, securing their first NBA championship in franchise history. In MLB, a recent game 7 that stands out is the 2016 World Series between the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians. In that game, the last two regulation runs were scored by Cubs outfielder Ben Zobrist and Indians outfielder Rajai Davis. Zobrist hit a double in the top of the 10th inning to drive in what would be the game-winning run, while Davis hit a two-run homer in the bottom of the eighth inning to tie the game at 6-6. The game ultimately ended with an 8-7 victory for the Cubs, securing their first World Series championship in over 100 years. In conclusion, depending on the league and the era, the last two players to score in regulation in game 7 can vary widely. However, some recent examples in the NHL, NBA, and MLB can give us a sense of the drama and excitement that can accompany these clutch moments in sports."},{"prompt":"Outstanding debts were also agreed and the company permitted to export 250 tons of saltpetre.

It is a significant fact that the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects, and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application.

Descartes's work, along with Avicenna's, prefigured the 19thcentury development of specificity theory. Specificity theory saw pain as a specific sensation, with its own sensory apparatus independent of touch and other senses. Another theory that came to prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries was intensive theory, which conceived of pain not as a unique sensory modality, but an emotional state produced by stronger than normal stimuli such as intense light, pressure or temperature. By the mid1890s, specificity was backed mostly by physiologists and physicians, and the intensive theory was mostly backed by psychologists. However, after a series of clinical observations by Henry Head and experiments by Max von Frey, the psychologists migrated to specificity almost en masse, and by century's end, most textbooks on physiology and psychology were presenting pain specificity as fact.

With that in mind, there are simple habits that could greatly benefit our lungs and overall well-being. One of the most efficient ways to improve our lung capacity is through exercise. Engaging in cardiovascular activities, such as running, swimming, or cycling, will help strengthen our respiratory muscles and increase our lung capacity. Additionally, deep breathing exercises, like yoga or meditation, can help regulate our lungs' functioning and improve overall respiratory health. Creating a peaceful environment is also essential for healthy lungs. Avoiding exposure to pollutants such as smoke, dust, and allergens can protect your respiratory system from harm. Using air filters and proper ventilation can help reduce indoor pollutants that can harm our lungs. Ingesting food can also affect our respiratory health. It is recommended to wait an hour or two after eating before engaging in physical activity. Digestion puts an extra strain on our lungs, and exercising immediately after eating can hinder proper breathing. Lastly, it is crucial to avoid physical injury or strain that could harm our lungs. Wear protective gear and use proper technique when engaging in physical activities that put pressure on your respiratory system. Taking care of our lungs is crucial for overall well-being.

I am a 'nontraditional' student, and, perhaps for reasons of yearslived or wisdomaccrued, appreciated the slow, reflective pacing of the film's narrative. Languorous with the heat and dust of an arid clime, the story is deeply psychological, replete with multilayered symbolism, and an articulate inversion of the theme of being the 'Other' in a land that one does not understand. the understanding that does come is fraught with the unresolved memories and subjectivity of the outsider. Made nearly 20 years ago, it is also a forerunner in a genre of numerous other international films that explore the themes of colonials in colonized spaces, clueless to the nuances of the cultures into which they have entered. Much more lavishly filmedand heavily financed works that have been made since reflect the same themes: Indochine, Nowhere in Africa are two that in comparison perhaps make Chocolat seem pale and boring.

The Teutonic Order was founded in the 12th century and reached the peak of its power in the 14th century, controlling vast territories in Eastern Europe. During this time, the order was led by a grandmaster who wielded immense political and military authority. Wennemar Hasenkamp von Brüggeneye and Andreas von Stierland were both grandmasters of the Teutonic Order, but they did not hold the position at the same time. Wennemar Hasenkamp von Brüggeneye was grandmaster from 1393 to 1407, while Andreas von Stierland was grandmaster from 1414 to 1441. Wennemar Hasenkamp von Brüggeneye was born in Germany and joined the Teutonic Order as a young man. He served as the grand commander of Prussia before being elected as grandmaster. During his tenure, he successfully repelled several attacks by the Kingdom of Poland, which was expanding into Teutonic territory. He also oversaw the construction of several major fortifications, including the castle at Marienburg. Andreas von Stierland was also a German-born Teutonic knight who rose through the ranks of the order before being elected grandmaster. His tenure was marked by conflict with the Kingdom of Poland, which culminated in the Grunwald/Hanibal's battle in 1410. The Teutonic Order suffered a crushing defeat in this battle, which led to a long period of decline. In conclusion, both Wennemar Hasenkamp von Brüggeneye and Andreas von Stierland were important figures in the history of the Teutonic Order, serving as grandmasters at different times.

Nominal claims, which are claims made in name only without any official action, may have existed before any official territorial claims were made. However, it is also possible that territorial claims were made and then later recognized through formal treaties or agreements. In general, the Burmese have a long history of claiming territory along the coast of present-day Myanmar, including the Tenasserim coast. The first Burmese kingdom, the Pagan Empire, had trading connections with the region as early as the 11th century. Over the years, various Burmese kingdoms and dynasties have attempted to exert control over the region, often coming into conflict with the Thai and European colonizers who also sought to dominate the area. During the 19th century, the British Empire became the dominant colonial power in the region. They signed a treaty with the Burmese kingdom in 1826, which ceded control of Tenasserim to the British. This led to a series of conflicts and uprisings, as some Burmese leaders continued to resist British control. In summary, while it is difficult to pinpoint the exact timeline of claims made by the Burmese on the Tenasserim coast, it is clear that they have a long history of asserting their influence and control over the region. The idea of a nominal claim versus a territorial claim may not be useful in this context, as these claims were likely intertwined and fluctuated throughout history."},{"prompt":"Insects (from Latin insectum, a calque of Greek ἔντομον [éntomon], cut into sections) are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a threepart body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. a good answer to the question How many parts comprise the body of an insect?

It is uncertain whether the young man had any prior experience performing such feats or had taken precautionary measures such as contacting professionals to carry out the jump safely. This incident highlights the importance of responsible drinking and decision-making, particularly during the festive season. Moreover, it brings to light the need for caution when attempting dangerous activities without the proper training or equipment. It is essential to prioritize safety before charity, and one must consider the possible consequences of their actions before attempting dangerous stunts.

Dry the fabric with a shammy towel.","completion":"If you want to keep your car's hood looking brand new, then it's important to know how to clean it properly. The steps are pretty straightforward, but it's important to follow them carefully for the best results. First, rinse the hood with water. This will help to remove any loose dirt or debris from the surface. Use a hose or a pressure washer if you have one, and make sure to spray the hood thoroughly, taking care to get all the corners and crevices. Next, you'll need to clean the fabric with auto shampoo. Choose a high-quality product that is specifically designed for automotive use, as this will give you the best results. Apply the shampoo to the fabric using a soft cloth or sponge, and work it into a lather. Make sure to cover the entire surface of the hood with the shampoo, and take your time to really work it in. After you've applied the shampoo, it's time to scrub the fabric with a stiff brush. This will help to remove deep stains and embedded dirt, so it's an important step. Choose a brush with bristles that are tough enough to remove stains, but not so tough that they'll damage the fabric. Use circular motions to scrub the hood, making sure to pay extra attention to any areas that are particularly stained or dirty. Finally, you'll need to dry the fabric with a shammy towel. This type of towel is great for drying automotive surfaces because it absorbs water quickly and leaves no streaks or residue behind. Use the towel to gently pat the fabric dry, taking care not to rub too hard or you could damage the fibers. And that's it! Following these steps will help you keep your car's hood looking great for years to come. Just remember to rinse, clean, scrub, and dry, and you'll have a hood that looks as good as new."},{"prompt":"Question: What is not the same between hand made and robotic amde mosaics?

During that excursion, Bell took a handmade model of his telephone with him, making it a working holiday.

The genetic code is read three nucleotides at a time, in units called codons, via interactions with specialized RNA molecules called transfer RNA (tRNA). Each tRNA has three unpaired bases known as the anticodon that are complementary to the codon it reads on the mRNA. The tRNA is also covalently attached to the amino acid specified by the complementary codon. When the tRNA binds to its complementary codon in an mRNA strand, the ribosome attaches its amino acid cargo to the new polypeptide chain, which is synthesized from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus.

David Cameron pledged to hold talks to get powers back from Brussels.","completion":"13 Million Words in EU Laws: A Struggle for UK Firms According to the campaign group Business for Britain, there are 13 million words in EU laws. This excessive regulation is making it difficult for UK firms to compete in a global marketplace. The cost and time-consuming nature of compliance with these laws hinders innovation and growth for companies of all sizes. The need to comply with EU regulation creates a hidden tax on British business, preventing companies from investing in their operations, hiring employees or increasing productivity. The red tape associated with these laws diverts limited resources away from the core business. This burden disproportionately affects smaller enterprises and start-ups, which lack the resources to hire legal or regulatory experts. The Business for Britain campaign group has called for a significant reduction in EU regulations, as the UK has the opportunity to take back control of its own destiny after Brexit. One way to accomplish this is by holding talks to repatriate powers from Brussels, that were previously administered by the EU. Recently, Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to hold these discussions following the Brexit vote. He recognized the need to ensure that British businesses can compete effectively in global markets. By reducing unnecessary EU regulations, businesses can free up resources for innovation, investing, and growth. In conclusion, the excessive regulations that UK firms are required to comply with creates a significant burden. The 13 million-word count of EU laws represents a hidden tax on businesses of all sizes. The Prime Minister's pledge to review these regulations and hold talks to repatriate powers from Brussels is welcome news for UK business.

Many countries in the region share similar cultures, languages, and lifestyles, which can facilitate communication and understanding. - Geographic advantage: The Mediterranean basin is a strategic location for transportation and commerce, as it connects Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.

However, many countries have shown a willingness to engage in dialogue, cooperation, and conflict resolution, through various forums and initiatives, such as the Union for the Mediterranean, the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, or the Barcelona Process.

This can sometimes lead to a feeling of being overwhelmed and paralyzed with indecision. However, there are several key steps we can take to effectively prioritize tasks, stop procrastinating, complete projects, and take responsibility for our lives. The first step in effectively managing our tasks is to prioritize them. This involves identifying the most urgent and important tasks, and completing them first. By focusing on the most crucial tasks, we can avoid wasting our time on activities that may be less relevant or time-sensitive. Another important step is to stop procrastinating. Procrastination is a common tendency among many of us, and often leads to a sense of anxiety and stress as work piles up. To overcome procrastination, it is important to identify the underlying reasons for the behavior, such as fear of failure or feeling overwhelmed, and find ways to address those issues. Once we have identified and prioritized our tasks, the next step is to complete our projects. This involves setting clear goals, outlining a plan of action, and staying focused on the task at hand. It may also involve seeking out support and resources to help us achieve our goals more efficiently and effectively. Ultimately, taking responsibility for our lives involves being accountable for our actions and decisions. This means taking ownership of our successes and failures, not blaming others for our mistakes, and being proactive in making positive changes in our lives. In summary, prioritizing tasks, stopping procrastination, completing projects, and taking responsibility are all essential steps in effectively managing our lives.

Age is primary risk factor; other factors: obesity, smoking, high blood pressure. Two forms of AMD: wet and dry; until recently few treatments were available. Injections containing antigrowth factor can slow progress of wet AMD. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is a common eye condition that causes central vision loss. This condition is most commonly associated with aging, but other factors such as obesity, smoking, and high blood pressure may increase the risk of developing AMD. The condition occurs in two forms - wet and dry - but until recently treatment options were limited for both forms. Dry AMD is the more common form, with its onset usually gradual. Small white or yellowish deposits called drusen can accumulate in the macula, the center of the retina, causing it to thin and dry out. This may result in blurred or dim vision, difficulty seeing in low-light settings, and scotomas (blind spots). Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for dry AMD, but some studies have suggested that a diet rich in antioxidants and omega-3s could slow its progression. Wet AMD, on the other hand, causes more rapid vision loss and is often accompanied by distorted or wavy lines, and a dark spot in the central vision. It is caused by the growth of abnormal blood vessels under the retina, which can leak blood and fluid into the macula, causing irreversible damage. Until recently, few treatments were available for wet AMD. However, recent medical advancements have led to the production of anti-growth factor injections. These injections can slow the progress of the disease, and in some cases even improve the patient’s vision. The treatment involves injecting a medication directly into the eye to block the growth of blood vessels and reduce the amount of fluid leaking into the retina. In conclusion, while AMD is a common condition that affects millions of people worldwide, there are several steps that can be taken to prevent or slow its progression. By maintaining a healthy lifestyle, getting regular eye exams, and seeking early treatment, it is possible to minimize the effects of AMD and maintain good vision for as long as possible."},{"prompt":"ere is a dialogue: Tom: Hey, you coming or not?

Disconnect your car alarm. Compare engine RPMs with the idle control motor disconnected.","completion":"Cars are complex machines that require proper maintenance to function at their best. Two essential parts of car maintenance are changing the spark plugs and checking battery connections regularly. In addition to that, disconnecting the car alarm and comparing the engine RPMs to the idle control motor can also be beneficial. One of the easiest and most affordable ways to improve your car's performance is by swapping out the spark plugs. Worn or dirty spark plugs can affect your car's fuel economy, acceleration, and overall performance. It is recommended that you change your spark plugs every 30,000 to 50,000 miles, but this may vary depending on the make and model of your car. Swapping out the spark plugs is a simple process that can be done with minimal tools and expertise. Checking your battery connections is another crucial part of car maintenance. A corroded battery connection can cause your car to fail to start, even if the battery is fully charged. Regularly inspecting the battery connections and cleaning them can significantly improve your car's electrical system's performance. Disconnecting your car alarm can also be beneficial to your car's performance. Car alarms are notorious for draining car batteries, and they can also cause false alarms that can be frustrating and time-consuming. Disconnecting the system can reduce the strain on your car's battery and electrical system. Finally, comparing engine RPMs with the idle control motor disconnected can provide useful information about the performance of your car's engine. The idle control motor regulates the engine's idle speed, and disconnecting it allows you to compare the RPMs to the manufacturer's specifications. This can help diagnose any issues with the engine that may be affecting performance. In conclusion, proper car maintenance is essential for optimal vehicle performance. Swapping out spark plugs, checking battery connections, disconnecting car alarms, and comparing engine RPMs are all simple steps that can significantly improve your car's performance. By following these maintenance tips, you can have a car that runs smoothly and efficiently for years to come."},{"prompt":"Aidan: hey I am coming to town this week and organizing a supper with some of our buds.

Later, Norman Heatley developed the back extraction technique for efficiently purifying penicillin in bulk. The chemical structure of penicillin was determined by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin in 1945. Purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans. Furthermore, its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus, unlike the synthetic sulfonamides. The discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented, and the development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety. For their successful development of penicillin, which Fleming had accidentally discovered but could not develop himself, as a therapeutic drug, Ernst Chain and Howard Florey shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Fleming. Florey credited Dubos with pioneering the approach of deliberately and systematically searching for antibacterial compounds, which had led to the discovery of gramicidin and had revived Florey's research in penicillin.

The 21yearold is well out of favour under Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford. Zaha is set to miss out on a spot in England's latest under21 squad.","completion":"Manchester United's young winger, Wilfried Zaha, has had a disappointing season so far, with his chances of playing for the club dwindling with every passing game. In their recent Capital One Cup match, Zaha was an unused substitute, as United were knocked out of the competition, much to the frustration of their fans. Despite being one of the most promising players in the United team, Zaha has found himself well out of favour under Louis van Gaal. The 21-year-old has had limited opportunities to showcase his skills and it seems that the Dutch coach is not impressed with what he has seen so far. Zaha's lack of playing time has also had an impact on his international prospects. The young winger is set to miss out on a place in the latest under-21 squad for England. This is a huge blow for Zaha, who was hoping to show his worth on the international stage and push for a place in the senior squad. It remains to be seen whether Zaha will ever fulfill his potential at Old Trafford. With so few opportunities coming his way, it may be in his best interest to seek a loan move away from the club in order to gain some much-needed playing time. It is clear that Zaha has talent, but he needs time and opportunities to develop his skills and prove himself at the highest level.

Now that you know how to properly prepare your lemons, you can enjoy the many benefits of drinking freshly squeezed lemon juice. Lemon juice is not only a delicious and refreshing beverage but also has many health benefits. It can help with digestion, detoxification, and can even boost your immune system.

Team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar confirmed the news, stating that Neymar suffered a fracture of the third vertebra in his back and will require at least a few weeks of rest to recover. The injury is a major blow for Brazil, as Neymar has been the team's talisman throughout the tournament, scoring four goals and leading the attack with his dynamic skills. Fans across Brazil were devastated by the news, with one supporter stating that \\"it's like we have lost today.\\" However, there has been an outpouring of support from around the world, including from Neymar's friend and rival Lionel Messi, who said, \\"I hope you recover very soon, friend!\\" Brazil will now have to rely on the rest of their squad to step up in Neymar's absence. The likes of Hulk, Oscar, and Fred will need to contribute more in attack, while defenders Thiago Silva and David Luiz will need to marshal the backline and provide leadership on the field. The team will also be boosted by the return of captain Thiago Silva, who missed the quarterfinal through suspension but will be available for the semifinal. Brazil's opponents in the semifinal, Germany, will also be missing a key player in midfielder Sami Khedira, who suffered a calf injury in the warm-up before their quarterfinal against France. Despite the setbacks, both Brazil and Germany will be determined to reach the final and lift the World Cup trophy.

Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters.

For small values of capacitance (microfarads and less), ceramic disks use metallic coatings, with wire leads bonded to the coating. Larger values can be made by multiple stacks of plates and disks. Larger value capacitors usually use a metal foil or metal film layer deposited on the surface of a dielectric film to make the plates, and a dielectric film of impregnated paper or plastic – these are rolled up to save space. To reduce the series resistance and inductance for long plates, the plates and dielectric are staggered so that connection is made at the common edge of the rolledup plates, not at the ends of the foil or metalized film strips that comprise the plates.

It is important to note that the Ottoman Empire was an extensive empire, and its borders were constantly shifting. The annexation of Ottoman territories took place over many years and was often a result of wars and political agreements. One of the most significant annexations of Ottoman territory took place after World War I when the empire was defeated and dissolved. The Treaty of Sevres, signed in 1920, led to the loss of significant territories for the Ottomans. The treaty resulted in the annulment of Turkey's sovereignty over many regions, including Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Iraq. Another notable annexation of Ottoman territory happened during the Balkan Wars in the early 20th century. This conflict led to the defeat of the Ottomans, resulting in the loss of significant territories in Europe, including Bulgaria, Greece, Montenegro, and Serbia. The empire's presence in Europe was reduced, and this marked the start of the end of the Ottoman Empire's influence in the region. In addition to these two significant annexations, there were various smaller annexations of Ottoman territories by different countries at different times. For example, the Venice Republic annexed some Ottoman territories in the 17th century. Russia also annexed territories in the Caucasus and the Black Sea region. In conclusion, the number of Ottoman territories that were annexed varies depending on the period and the country or empire that was involved. The most significant annexations took place after World War I and during the Balkan Wars. The Ottoman Empire's decline was marked by the loss of significant territories that drastically reduced its influence in the world."},{"prompt":"the next sentence syntactically and semantically acceptable?

As with any mature content, parents and guardians must make informed decisions about what their children watch and when. Regardless of the controversy, Fifty Shades of Grey is expected to be a box office hit and draw crowds of fans eager to see the steamy romance play out on the big screen.

The first step is to identify the distance that you want to convert. Whether it is from miles to kilometers or vice versa, it is crucial to know the units you are starting with and the units you want to end with. Once you have identified the distance, the next step is to determine the correct conversion factor. Conversion factors are ratios that represent the relationship between different units of measurement. For example, if you are converting miles to kilometers, the conversion factor is 1.60934 kilometers in a mile. After identifying the conversion factor, the next step is to multiply the original distance by the conversion factor. This process will give you the new converted distance in the desired unit of measurement. It is essential to ensure that you use the correct conversion factor to avoid errors in your calculations. If you find yourself struggling with conversions, do not hesitate to seek help. There are online conversion tools that can help you convert distances quickly and accurately. Additionally, you can seek help from friends, family, or professionals who are well-versed in conversion calculations. In conclusion, converting distances does not have to be a daunting task.

Right now ballistic missile defence system technology not up to scratch. Not even the US could defend itself with its system if a major threat came. Best missile technology for Australia exists on US and Japanese warships. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"A recent study has recommended that Australia should continue investing in missile research in order to improve its defence capabilities. The study found that the current technology for ballistic missile defence systems is not up to scratch, posing a significant threat to national security. The study suggests that even the United States, a global superpower, would struggle to defend itself against a major missile threat. This highlights the urgent need for countries like Australia to invest in developing better missile technology. Fortunately, the study found that the best missile technology currently exists on US and Japanese warships. This presents an opportunity for Australia to collaborate with these countries and learn from their expertise. Investing in missile research and development will not only enhance Australia's defence capabilities but also contribute to the nation's economic growth. As technology advances, new job opportunities will be created, and Australia has the potential to become a global leader in missile technology. It is important for the government to recognize the significance of this issue and prioritize funding for research and development.

Paramedic testifies Dr. Conrad Murray said he was treating Jackson for dehydration. Paris Jackson cried Daddy! as Murray tried to revive her dad, witness says. Murray delayed calling 911 for 21 minutes, prosecutor says.","completion":"In the trial of Dr. Conrad Murray, who was charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Michael Jackson, witnesses provided gripping testimony that shed light on the tragic events of that fateful day. One witness testified that when the ambulance arrived, Michael Jackson appeared to be already dead. This supports the prosecution's argument that Dr. Murray's negligence and incompetence led to Jackson's untimely passing. Another witness, a paramedic, testified that Dr. Murray told him he was treating Jackson for dehydration. But the paramedic was skeptical, as the signs of cardiac arrest were evident. The testimony suggests that Dr. Murray was either mistaken or being dishonest about what he was treating Jackson for. Perhaps the most heart-wrenching testimony came from Michael Jackson's daughter, Paris. According to a witness, she cried out \\"Daddy!\\" as Dr. Murray attempted to revive her father. This testimony shows the devastating impact Michael Jackson's death had on his family, particularly his children. The prosecution argued that Dr. Murray delayed calling 911 for 21 minutes after discovering Jackson's lifeless body. This delay, they suggested, deprived Jackson of crucial time that could have saved his life. If Dr. Murray had acted faster, it's possible that Jackson might have been resuscitated. All of these testimonies provide valuable insights into the events surrounding Michael Jackson's death. While the trial was a painful and difficult chapter for Jackson's family and fans, it was also an important step in holding those responsible accountable for their actions. The public's fascination with Michael Jackson can never fully be explained, but the trial hoped to bring some degree of closure and justice to his memory."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: sri lanka cricket team highest score in test?","completion":"The highest score of Sri Lanka cricket team in Test is 952/6 declared against India in 1997."},{"prompt":"(1) Guy Stern ( born January 14 , 1922 in Hildesheim ) is a GermanJewish literary scholar , primarily German and comparative literature .

Obama's job approval rating slumps to personal low of 40 per cent.","completion":"With only four days remaining to avoid default next Tuesday, the pressure is on for the United States to reach a resolution on the debt ceiling crisis. World Bank President, Robert Zoellick, is speaking out against the U.S., slamming them for playing with fire. Zoellick warns that a failure to reach an agreement could have serious global repercussions. Compounding the problem is the fact that the U.S. economy expanded at an annual rate of only 1.3 per cent in the spring. This slow growth rate, along with the debt crisis, has resulted in a decrease in consumer confidence and investment, causing Wall Street markets to have their worst week of 2011. The losses on Wall Street have been significant, but there is some optimism as the markets posted smaller losses today. However, with the clock ticking down to the deadline, it remains to be seen whether or not the markets will be able to rebound. Adding to the woes of the U.S. government, President Obama's job approval rating has slumped to a personal low of 40 per cent. This is likely due, at least in part, to the ongoing debt crisis and the perceived inaction of the government to address the problem. Overall, the situation in the United States is concerning for both the country and the world economy. The pressure is on for the U.S. to find a way to avoid default and reach a resolution on the debt ceiling crisis.

Digestion is the process of breaking down food into nutrients. There are two types of digestion: mechanical digestion and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion occurs when large chunks are turned into smaller chucks. Perhaps not surprisingly, this happens when you chew your food. Once you swallow the food, your stomach also does some of this work. Chemical digestion occurs when food is broken down into useful nutrients. This is a chemical process that begins as you start to chew your food. The saliva in your mouth starts this process. Once you swallow, the acid in your stomach further breaks down food. From the stomach, the foods moves into the small intestine. In the small intestines, another set of chemicals goes to work. Are you surprised?

However, they can be challenging to work with if you don't blend them properly. Here are some tips on how to get the most out of your oil pastels. Pre-blend your oil pastels: Before you start your project, it's a good idea to pre-blend your oil pastels. This means taking similar colors and rubbing them together to create a smooth blend. Doing this ahead of time will save you time and effort when it comes to blending on your paper. Blend your oil pastels: Blending is crucial to achieving a professional-looking finish with oil pastels. You can do this by layering colors and then blending them together with a blending tool, such as a blending stump or your finger. You can also use a solvent, such as mineral spirits, to blend the colors even further. Be careful not to overblend, as this can muddy the colors. Color mix or overlay your oil pastels: Mixing and overlaying colors can create interesting and unique effects. You can do this by layering different colors on top of each other, or by using a colorless blender to blend colors together. Overlapping colors can create a depth to your artwork that a single color cannot achieve. In conclusion, oil pastels are a versatile medium that can produce some stunning results when used correctly. Remember to pre-blend your colors, blend them properly, and experiment with mixing and overlaying colors to achieve a variety of effects. With these tips, you'll be on your way to creating beautiful oil pastel artwork in no time."},{"prompt":"Read this: Throughout most of his career, Athanasius had many detractors.

Each condition requires a different treatment method, and what works for someone else might not necessarily work for you. During your consultation, you should talk to your doctor about the benefits and disadvantages of each treatment option, and consider the risks involved. One treatment option that a doctor may suggest is surgery. Surgery aims to remove the affected area in your body or alleviate some of the symptoms of a condition. While surgery may be the most effective option for some patients, it may not be suitable for others. Some patients may not be healthy enough to undergo surgery, while others may not want to have surgery. Therefore, it's important to have an honest conversation with your doctor to determine if surgery is a viable option for you. Another treatment option to consider is radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is a non-invasive treatment that involves the use of high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells or reduce the size of tumors. This treatment can be used alone or with other treatments such as chemotherapy. The side effects of radiation therapy are minimal and may include skin irritation and fatigue. Your doctor may recommend radiation therapy if surgery is not a viable option, or if you require further treatment after surgery. Chemotherapy is another treatment option that involves using medication to kill cancer cells or reduce the size of tumors. Chemotherapy can be used alone or in combination with other treatments such as radiation therapy. The side effects of chemotherapy can be severe, and may include nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and fatigue. Your doctor may recommend chemotherapy if surgery and radiation therapy are not suitable options or as a follow-up treatment after surgery.

Uyghurs speak a language related to Turkish, have close ties to central Asia. Migration of Han Chinese to the region has fueled tensions. Tensions have sporadically erupted into violence.","completion":"China's Xinjiang autonomous region, located in the northwestern part of the country, is a region with a rich and complex history of friction. One of the main causes of this friction can be attributed to the region's Uyghur population. The Uyghurs are an ethnic group with close ties to central Asia, who speak a language related to Turkish. However, the migration of Han Chinese to the region has fueled tensions over the years. The Han Chinese make up the majority of China's population, and their migration to the Xinjiang region has been ongoing for several decades. This migration has made the Uyghurs feel like they are being pushed out of their own land, and has led to an immense feeling of resentment between the two communities. Tensions between the Uyghurs and the Han Chinese have sporadically erupted into violence. The most significant incident was in 2009, when riots broke out in the region's capital, Urumqi. The riots lasted for several days, resulting in the deaths of nearly 200 people and the injury of thousands more. The Chinese authorities cracked down on the Uyghur population following these riots, which caused further anger and resentment among the Uyghur community. The Uyghur population's desire for autonomy has been a recurring issue in the region, and the Chinese government has been actively suppressing any forms of dissent. The government has been cracking down on the Uyghurs, with reports of arbitrary detention and torture in \\"re-education\\" camps. This suppression of the Uyghur population has created international condemnation from many countries, calling China's actions a violation of human rights. In conclusion, the long history of friction in China's Xinjiang autonomous region has been fueled by the migration of Han Chinese and their tense relationship with the Uyghur population. The sporadic violence that has erupted has caused immense suffering and has led to the suppression of the Uyghurs by the Chinese government. The Uyghur population's call for autonomy has been met with resistance, and the Chinese government's actions have been internationally criticized. The situation in Xinjiang remains a grave concern, and a peaceful resolution seems a long way off."},{"prompt":"w would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? Why not efaxes?

The first comprehensive theories of mountain building were proposed during this period, as were the first modern theories of earthquakes and volcanoes. Louis Agassiz and others established the reality of continentcovering ice ages, and fluvialists like Andrew Crombie Ramsay argued that river valleys were formed, over millions of years by the rivers that flow through them.

Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift was widely dismissed when he proposed it in the 1910s, but new data gathered in the 1950s and 1960s led to the theory of plate tectonics, which provided a plausible mechanism for it.
