In addition, unreliable funding, long hours and low pay can result in employee retention problems.

The carvedtop or archtop mandolin has a much shallower, arched back, and an arched top—both carved out of wood.

Each style of instrument has its own sound quality and is associated with particular forms of music. Neapolitan mandolins feature prominently in European classical music and traditional music.

Have food at room temperature. Do not smoke or drink alcohol. Raise your bed 15 to 20 centimetres (5.9 to 7.9 in) to help you sleep. Avoid wearing tight clothing around your neck or abdominal area. Consider losing weight if you are overweight. Try deep breathing exercises to relax your esophagus.","completion":"Acid reflux is a common condition that causes discomfort and pain to millions of people worldwide. Although it can be challenging to manage, there are some simple tips that can help reduce its symptoms. One of the most effective ways to manage acid reflux is by having several small meals throughout the day. This will prevent your stomach from becoming too full, which can trigger acid reflux. Additionally, it is essential to avoid spicy, acidic foods that can irritate your throat and stomach lining. Having food at room temperature is another helpful tip to alleviate acid reflux. Eating hot or cold food can shock your system and aggravate your condition. Therefore, try to keep your meals at room temperature to prevent any unnecessary discomfort. If you are a smoker or alcohol consumer, it is advisable to stop these habits as they can worsen acid reflux symptoms. Smoking and alcohol consumption weaken the lower esophageal sphincter, a muscle that separates the stomach and esophagus, making it easier for stomach acid to flow back up. Elevating your bed 15 to 20 centimeters (5.9 to 7.9 in) can help you sleep better if you suffer from acid reflux. Lying down flat puts pressure on your stomach, making it easier for stomach acid to flow back up. Raising the head of your bed elevates your head and upper body, reducing the reflux of acid. Wearing tight clothing around your neck or abdominal area can put pressure on your stomach, exacerbating your acid reflux symptoms. It's best to wear loose and comfortable clothing that allows your stomach and diaphragm to expand comfortably. If you are overweight, losing weight is one of the most effective ways to reduce acid reflux symptoms. Excess weight puts pressure on your stomach, increasing the risk of reflux. Finally, deep breathing exercises are an effective way to relax the esophagus and alleviate acid reflux. Taking deep breaths can help reduce stress and anxiety, which are common triggers for acid reflux. In conclusion, acid reflux can be an uncomfortable and painful condition, but it can be managed by adopting a few simple lifestyle changes. Have small meals throughout the day, avoid spicy and acidic food, quit smoking and alcohol, raise your bed, wear loose clothing, lose weight if you're overweight, and try deep breathing exercises to relax your esophagus. By following these tips, you can significantly reduce the symptoms of acid reflux and improve your quality of life."},{"prompt":"@Colmbear yeh im jus going to miss people Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.

The twotime Olympic gold medallist is currently serving a 30day ban.

This has put her at risk of being left out of the squad for the upcoming Women's World Cup. Solo was banned last week, just two days after she was a passenger in a car driven by her husband, Jerramy Stevens, who was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence. The ban will last until February 16, and during this time Solo will not be allowed to train with the team or participate in any games. While Solo has not been charged with any crime, United States Soccer Federation (USSF) President Sunil Gulati said in a statement that \\"the decision was made in light of the conduct\\" that led to Stevens' arrest. Gulati also said that Solo's ongoing personal situation \\"does not comport with the image of our team or of female athletes.\\" Solo, who is widely considered one of the best goalkeepers in the world, has been a key part of the United States women's national soccer team for over a decade. She has helped the team win two Olympic gold medals and was the goalkeeper for the 2015 Women's World Cup-winning team. However, her recent off-field issues have raised questions about her future with the team. Some fans and commentators have criticized the USSF for not taking stronger action against Solo, while others have called for her to be given a second chance. At this point, it remains to be seen whether Solo will be included in the squad for the Women's World Cup. The tournament, which will be held in France this summer, is one of the most prestigious events in women's soccer, and the United States is one of the favorites to win. As Solo serves her ban, the team will have to evaluate its options and decide whether to stick with its longtime goalkeeper or make a change. Regardless of the outcome, the controversy surrounding Solo's ban serves as a reminder of the high standards expected of athletes both on and off the field."},{"prompt":"Write some highlights for the following article: Misrata, Libya (CNN","completion":"Sorry, I cannot provide highlights for an article without its text.

The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheetlike muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens.

Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened.

Instead, try to become an active part of their weight-loss program by offering to exercise together, helping with meal prep or supporting them in whatever way they need.

The fighters killed four civilians and a soldier, residents and Chadian security sources said.","completion":"Boko Haram, the Islamist extremist group infamous for its terrorist activities in Nigeria, has recently carried out its first known deadly attack in the neighboring country of Chad. The United Nations agency has confirmed the incident, which claimed the lives of at least four civilians and one soldier. According to sources from within Chadian security forces, the fighters conducted the attack in the Lake Chad region, which borders Nigeria, Chad, Niger, and Cameroon. The militants struck a village known as Kaiga Kindjiria, situated near the Chadian border with Niger, early on Saturday morning. The news of this deadly raid by Boko Haram will undoubtedly deepen the existing security concerns in the region. The group's violent insurgency in Nigeria, which began over a decade ago, has escalated in recent years and led to over 36,000 fatalities. The group has also carried out attacks in neighboring countries such as Chad, Cameroon, and Niger, which have displaced over 2.5 million people. The Chadian President, Idriss Deby Itno, declared a state of emergency in the region in 2015, and since then, his government has taken steps to counter the threat posed by Boko Haram. Chad, which is a member of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF), has deployed thousands of troops to the Lake Chad region to fight the extremists. Despite these efforts, Boko Haram has continued to carry out attacks indiscriminately, targeting civilians and security forces alike. The recent attack in Chad is a reminder that the group remains a significant security threat in the region, and more needs to be done to defeat it. The international community must continue to support the countries affected by Boko Haram and provide them with the necessary resources to combat the group. While military operations and counter-terrorism measures are vital, any long-term solution to the crisis in the region will require addressing the socio-economic factors that have contributed to the group's growth and expanded its influence. In conclusion, Boko Haram's recent deadly attack in Chad highlights the ongoing security challenges posed by the extremist group in the region. It underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to address the crisis, which requires not only military actions but also addressing the underlying factors that have led to the group's growth and attractivity."},{"prompt":"Static electricity is like a teetertotter.

One of the most infamous incidents was the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572, in which thousands of French Protestants were killed. In addition to violent attacks, Protestants were also frequently forced to flee from their homes and communities. This often meant leaving behind their possessions and livelihoods, and facing difficult conditions on the road or in refugee camps. It is difficult to determine an exact number of Protestants who died as a result of these forced displacements and the privations that came with them. However, estimates suggest that the total number could be in the hundreds of thousands. For example, during the Eighty Years' War in the Netherlands (1568-1648), many Protestants were driven from their homes by Spanish Catholic forces. Some estimates suggest that up to 100,000 Protestants died as a result of the conflict, either directly or indirectly. Similarly, in England during the reign of Queen Mary I (1553-1558), many Protestants were burned at the stake for their religious beliefs. Others were forced to flee the country to avoid persecution, and some may have died as a result of harsh conditions during their exile. Overall, while the exact number of Protestants who died as a result of persecution and forced displacement during the Protestant Reformation is difficult to determine, it is clear that the number is significant.

One effective way to accomplish this is to explain your objective to the audience as you set up the trick. By providing an explanation of what you are trying to achieve with the trick, you help the audience understand what they should be looking for and increase their sense of excitement and wonder. For example, if you are performing a card trick, you might explain that your objective is to locate the audience member's chosen card and then proceed to shuffle the deck in a way that creates suspense as they wait to see if you can accomplish your goal. In addition to building suspense, explaining your objective can also help to establish credibility with the audience. By showing that you have a clear understanding of what you are trying to accomplish and how you plan to do it, you create a sense of trust and competence that can enhance the audience's enjoyment of the performance. Of course, it's important to strike a balance when explaining your objective. You don't want to give away too much information and ruin the surprise of the trick, but you also don't want to be too vague and leave the audience unsure of what to expect. The key is to provide just enough information to build anticipation and excitement, but also to leave room for mystery and surprise. Ultimately, explaining your objective to the audience as you set up the trick can be a powerful way to engage and captivate them. By creating a sense of anticipation and credibility, you set the stage for a truly magical performance that will leave your audience wanting more."},{"prompt":"f In the New York Times Book Review , Nicholas Jenkins says the poetry articulates with dreamlike clarity not the perfections of European and American culture, but its chronic anguish ..., can we conclude that Many people care what Nicholas Jenkins says about poems.?

Sajid Javid will commit Tories to strengthening law on journalists' freedoms. New Bill of Rights 'will restore British judges as arbiters of justice', he says. Measures should include legal right for journalists to protect their sources.","completion":"The Culture Secretary, Sajid Javid, has announced that the Bill of Rights should include protection for the freedom of the press. Javid has committed the Conservative party to strengthening the laws on journalists' freedoms in the UK. The creation of a new Bill of Rights would also restore British judges as arbiters of justice. Currently, the law in the UK is influenced by the European Court of Human Rights, and many argue that this limits the power of British courts. By restoring the power of British judges, the new Bill of Rights would give more control over the legal system to UK judges. One of the key measures that Javid wants to include in the new Bill of Rights is a legal right for journalists to protect their sources. This would ensure that journalists can continue to report on issues of public interest without fear of being prosecuted or silenced. The press plays a vital role in holding those in power accountable, and it is essential that their freedom is protected. Javid sees the new Bill of Rights as an opportunity to strengthen this protection. There have been concerns raised about the potential impact of the new Bill of Rights on human rights more broadly. However, Javid has stated that the focus of the new Bill of Rights will be on protecting basic liberties such as freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Overall, the inclusion of protections for the press in the new Bill of Rights is a welcome move.

Before hitting the road or taking a walk, it’s important to make sure pathways are clear of snow and ice to prevent any unnecessary accidents. Here are some tips for clearing snow effectively: 1. Clear off your car and walkways first. Clearing your car and walkways should be done before tackling any other areas. This will help ensure safe access when leaving or entering your home. If your car is covered in snow, clearing the roof and hood first will reduce the amount of snow that falls onto the ground and impairs your visibility. Then, move to the walkway and entrance to your home. 2. Make circular motions if there is no wind. When shoveling snow or using other tools to clear your walkway, make circular motions to help evenly distribute the snow. This will make the job easier and prevent accumulation in one spot. If there is no wind, this method is most effective. 3. Work side to side if there is wind. If there is wind, working side to side is a better approach. This will help to prevent the wind from pushing snow back into cleared areas. As with circular motions, this method will help prevent snow from accumulating in one spot and make the job easier overall. 4. Shovel any remaining snow. After using your snow-clearing tool of choice, a thin layer of snow may be left behind. Shovel any remaining snow to ensure clear pathways and prevent accidents. By following these tips, you can effectively clear snow from your car and walkways. Remember to take breaks as needed and be careful when working in cold weather conditions.

You can see how it occurs in the following diagram and animation. You have no doubt seen lightning in a rainstorm. What does lighting have to do with static electricity? As it turns out, everything! During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of different charges. This happens due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles. The negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds. The positive charges are concentrated at the top. The negative charges repel electrons on the ground below.

The pair would send photos of a woman to entice the victims into coming to certain addresses. Once there, the victims were ambushed in secluded alleyways and subjected to violence and robbery. Adding to the scheme, Beeson's girlfriend, Lorna Yeates, helped lure one victim into an alleyway. For her part in the crime, Yeates has also been sentenced to 14 months in prison.

It also highlights the need for better safeguards to prevent such crimes from being perpetrated in the first place. The victims in this case will likely continue to deal with the psychological effects of the trauma they experienced.

The construction of gods and spirits like persons is one of the best known traits of religion. He cites examples from Greek mythology, which is, in his opinion, more like a modern soap opera than other religious systems.

Sigmund Freud also suggested that god concepts are projections of one's father.

Additionally, powder blush tends to last longer than cream blush, making it a great option for those with oily or combination skin. On the other hand, cream blush is becoming increasingly popular. It's great for those with dry skin because it adds hydration while also providing color. Cream blush creates a more natural, dewy finish and can be easily blended in with your fingers. Plus, it can also be used on your lips for a cohesive look. When choosing the right shade of blush, consider your skin tone. If you have fair skin, pink or peach tones work well. If you have medium skin, warm shades like coral or bronze are a great choice. Lastly, for those with dark skin, opt for deeper shades like berry or plum. Lastly, there are many benefits to using cream blush. As previously mentioned, it's hydrating and creates a more natural finish. It's also great for those who want a more \\"no-makeup\\" makeup look.

As of September 2021, the longest field goal in NFL history was 66 yards, kicked by Matt Prater in 2013. The second longest field goal was 64 yards, also kicked by Prater in 2018. As for the third longest field goal, the distance ranges from 63 yards to 63.5 yards depending on which era of football is being analyzed. In today's NFL, there are only five instances of a field goal of 63 yards or longer being successfully kicked. The first to achieve this feat was Tom Dempsey, a kicker for the New Orleans Saints in 1970. Dempsey's record-setting kick was 63 yards, and it stood for over 40 years until Prater broke it in 2013. Since Dempsey's kick, only four other kickers have made field goals of 63 yards or longer: Jason Elam (1998), Sebastian Janikowski (2011), David Akers (2012), and Graham Gano (2018). All of these kicks were also 63 yards in length. However, if we expand our analysis to include pre-modern football eras, there are a few instances of field goals that may surpass the 63-yard mark. For example, in 1924, a college kicker named Ove Johansson made a 63.5-yard field goal, which would be the longest in football history if recognized by the NFL. Similarly, another college kicker, Russell Erxleben, made a 67-yard field goal in 1977, but again, this was not recognized by the NFL. In summary, the length of the third longest field goal in football history ranges from 63 to 63.5 yards, depending on whether we limit our analysis to the modern NFL or consider pre-modern football eras."},{"prompt":"Are these paraphrases?

It's not difficult to understand where these accusations come from, given the recent string of negative headlines and scandals surrounding the Conservative party. For example, there was the vote-rigging scandal in Falkirk, which left many questioning the integrity of the Tory party and its members. Additionally, revelations about the unethical behavior of Paul Flowers only served to further tarnish the party's reputation. Of course, not everyone is on board with these accusations. The Tory chairman, for one, criticized them as being nothing more than a \\"pathetic attempt to evade serious issues.\\" Nevertheless, it's hard to deny that the Labour leader has a certain degree of legitimacy in his accusations.

Now, the question becomes: what can be done about all of this? It's clear that there is a certain amount of mud-slinging going on, but is it really possible to eliminate this kind of behavior from politics entirely? There are certainly those who believe that it is possible - that we can create a political landscape that is guided by principles of fairness, honesty, and transparency. On the other hand, there are many who would argue that politics has always been a dirty game, and that mud-slinging is just a part of the process. They might say that, while it's not ideal, it's simply the price we pay for having a system that allows for robust debate and competition.
