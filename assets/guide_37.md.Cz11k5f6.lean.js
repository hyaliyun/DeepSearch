Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction. Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs.

First and foremost, you'll want to hold the ball in a way similar to how a fast bowler would. This will help give you better control over the ball as you prepare to release it. Next, you'll want to position your bowling arm vertically and close to your head. This will help you generate more power and accuracy as you swing your arm down towards the target. As you step forward, be sure to use your non-dominant foot – this will help you balance yourself and maintain good posture throughout the delivery. As you approach the release point, it's important to rotate your torso in order to generate even more momentum behind the ball. Additionally, raising your non-bowling arm can help you further improve your balance and control. Finally, be sure to position your legs correctly and deliver the ball smoothly and confidently. By following these simple steps, you can help ensure that you're using the proper technique and maximizing your potential out on the bowling lanes.

This will induce an additional current in the antenna element, changing the current at the feedpoint for a given feedpoint voltage. Thus the antenna's impedance, given by the ratio of feedpoint voltage to current, is altered due to the antenna's proximity to the ground. This can be quite a significant effect when the antenna is within a wavelength or two of the ground. But as the antenna height is increased, the reduced power of the reflected wave (due to the inverse square law) allows the antenna to approach its asymptotic feedpoint impedance given by theory. At lower heights, the effect on the antenna's impedance is very sensitive to the exact distance from the ground, as this affects the phase of the reflected wave relative to the currents in the antenna.

In a recent sermon, Lord Carey highlighted what he sees as a dangerous trend of the Church trying to follow political fashions, rather than remaining true to its core beliefs. The former Archbishop warned against what he called a \\"dangerous\\" trend of the Church trying to follow political fashions. Lord Carey argued that the Church must remain true to its core beliefs in order to avoid internal ruptures. He also expressed concern about the impact that trends in ministry, marriage, and sexuality are having on the Church. Lord Carey's comments come at a time of significant change and debate within the Church of England. Issues such as same-sex marriage and the ordination of women as bishops have sparked heated debate within the Church, with some traditionalists threatening to break away if the Church moves too far away from traditional teaching. Lord Carey's comments will be seen by many as a warning to the Church to maintain its traditional teachings and not to be swayed by the pressures of modern society. However, his comments will also be viewed by some as an attempt to stifle debate and progress within the Church. The former Archbishop is known for his conservative views, particularly on matters of sexuality and marriage. However, his warnings about the need for the Church to remain united and true to its core beliefs will be welcomed by many within the Church. In conclusion, Lord Carey's sermon highlights the challenges facing the Church of England today. His warning against trying to follow political fashions and his call for the Church to get its house in order will be seen by some as a conservative stance, while others will view it as a reflection of the Church's traditional teachings. Whatever the interpretation, it is clear that the Church of England is facing a time of significant change and debate, and that its future will be shaped by how it responds to these challenges."},{"prompt":"This must have been an embarrassment to every member of the entirely AfricanAmerican cast.

Consuming a balanced diet that is rich in certain nutrients is vital for maintaining healthy hair. Here are six nutrients that can help give your hair the boost it needs. 1. Keratin: Our hair is primarily made up of a protein called keratin. Eating foods that contain keratin helps to strengthen hair and promote growth. Foods like eggs, poultry, fish, and meat are all good sources of keratin. 2. Protein: Eating a protein-rich diet is essential for healthy hair growth because the hair shaft is comprised of protein. Incorporate sources like beans, nuts, and low-fat dairy products into your diet. 3. Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Omega-3s play a crucial role in the health of our skin and hair. Consuming an adequate amount of omega-3s can help prevent dry and brittle hair. Some foods to incorporate into your diet include salmon, chia seeds, flaxseeds, and walnuts. 4. Vitamin C: Our body needs vitamin C to produce collagen, which is important for maintaining healthy hair. Eating foods like citrus fruits, kiwi, strawberries, and peppers can help up your vitamin C intake. 5. Biotin: Biotin is a B vitamin that helps our body produce keratin. Eating foods like eggs, almonds, peanut butter, and sweet potatoes can help increase biotin levels. 6. Cystine: Cystine is an amino acid that helps to strengthen hair and prevent damage. Eating foods that contain cystine such as eggs, poultry, and red peppers can help promote healthy hair growth.

The point after gave the Eagles the lead, and it seemed as though they had pulled out a dramatic victory.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"The managing director of a major UK retailer, Andy Street, has issued a stark warning that companies using tax havens will outperform and ultimately surpass UK businesses. In a statement, Street made clear that unless the government addresses the issue of tax avoidance, companies that use tax havens will be able to \\"out-invest and ultimately out-trade us.\\" The warning comes after high-profile grilling sessions with bosses from Amazon, Google and Starbucks by MPs over their \\"immoral\\" tax avoidance schemes. These companies, along with many others, are using tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of UK taxes. The use of tax havens is a controversial issue, with many arguing that it is immoral and unethical. Tax havens provide a way for companies to avoid taxes by moving their profits to low-tax jurisdictions, where they can pay minimal rates of tax. Street's warning highlights the need for action from the government to address this issue. Unless action is taken to close tax loopholes and address tax avoidance, UK businesses will continue to be outperformed by those that use tax havens. The UK government has already taken some steps to address the issue of tax avoidance, with recent changes to the tax laws intended to crack down on this practice. However, more needs to be done to ensure that all companies pay their fair share of UK taxes. In the wake of Street's warning, it is clear that the issue of tax avoidance must be taken seriously. UK businesses cannot continue to be at a disadvantage to those that use tax havens, and the UK government must take action to ensure a level playing field for all."},{"prompt":"Apple Locks Out RealNetworks With iPod Update (PC World) PC World IPod Photo won't play songs purchased from Real.

This might happen because of heavy rains. Floodplains In very flat regions, flood water may spread out on the surface of the land. It then slows down and drops its sediment. If a river floods often, a floodplain develops. A floodplain is an area where a thick layer of rich soil is left behind as the floodwater recedes. Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert.

One of the key elements to developing a believable and engaging character is to craft an interesting backstory. This includes thinking about where your character comes from, their family and upbringing, and any significant events that may have shaped them. Once you have established your character's backstory, it's important to consider who their friends and allies will be. This can include close friends, family members, and even love interests. These relationships can help to bring your character to life and add depth to their personality. No story would be complete without a villain or enemy for the protagonist to overcome. This can range from a traditional antagonist such as a sinister mastermind or evil sorcerer, to a more internal struggle such as addiction or self-doubt. This creates a compelling conflict that keeps readers on the edge of their seats. It's also important to consider where your character fits into the timeline of your story. Are they a new arrival in a strange land, or have they been part of the world for generations? This can help to shape their personality and behavior, as well as provide context for their actions within the larger story. Finally, don't be afraid to get creative and draw or write stories about your finished character. This can help to flesh out their personality and backstory even further, and can also serve as a valuable tool for brainstorming future plot points and character development. Overall, creating a rich and engaging character is a vital part of crafting a captivating story. By considering their backstory, relationships, enemies, place in the timeline, and creating additional content around them, you can bring your character to life in a way that keeps readers invested and eager for more."},{"prompt":"Do these questions have the same meaning?

According to Roos, they were entertained by Hamid for the entire flight, while the co-pilots smoked, chatted, and even took photos with the two young women. It is a shocking revelation that adds another layer to the mystery of what happened on that fateful flight in March 2014. The disappearance of MH 370 is one of the most baffling aviation mysteries in history. Despite extensive searches, no wreckage has been found, and no one knows what truly happened to the plane and its 239 passengers and crew members. Roos' claim that she was able to enter the cockpit and spend time with one of the pilots during a flight raises concerns about the security measures in place at the time. It also adds to the speculation that there may have been other breaches in security on board MH 370. It is not yet clear whether Roos' claim has been corroborated or validated by other sources. Malaysian authorities have not yet commented on the matter. The tragedy of MH 370 remains a sobering reminder of the fragility and complexity of air travel, as well as the importance of maintaining robust safety and security protocols to prevent such disasters from occurring in the future.

Be sure to choose a brush that is gentle enough to avoid damaging the mats, but effective enough to get them clean. A mild soap or detergent can be used to create a soapy solution for cleaning. Focus on scrubbing any particularly dirty or stained areas, making sure to cover the entire surface of the mats. This step may take some time, but it's important to be thorough to ensure that the mats are as clean as possible. Once the mats have been scrubbed and cleaned, it's time to rinse them off once again.

Your core muscles, which include your abdominals, hips, and lower back, are responsible for supporting your spine and pelvis, maintaining good posture, and generating the power and stability needed for many everyday activities and sports. One effective way to build core strength is through targeted exercises. Here are five exercises you can incorporate into your fitness routine: 1. Plank - The plank is a classic core exercise that targets your abs, back, and shoulders. To perform a plank, start in a push-up position and lower yourself onto your forearms. Hold your body in a straight line for as long as you can, keeping your core engaged and your hips lifted. 2. Side plank - The side plank is a variation on the plank that specifically targets your obliques, the muscles on the sides of your abs. To perform a side plank, lie on your side with your forearm on the floor and your feet stacked on top of each other. Lift your hips off the ground and hold for as long as you can. 3. Leg lifts - Leg lifts are an effective exercise for targeting your lower abs. To perform leg lifts, lie on your back with your legs straight and lift them up to a 45-degree angle. Keep your core engaged and lower your legs back down, without touching the floor, and repeat. 4. Side leg lifts - Side leg lifts are a variation on leg lifts that target your outer thighs and hips.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Footballer's adverts for a popular brew have been deemed \\"misleading\\" by the UK's advertising watchdog, following an investigation that found French hops featured in the advert were not a significant ingredient. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received a complaint about the advertising campaign, which starred the footballer prominently and emphasized the drink's use of \\"fine French hops.\\" The complaint argued that the adverts misleadingly suggested the hops were a key ingredient in the drink. However, the ASA investigation found that the hops in question were only used in small quantities and did not contribute significantly to the flavour of the drink. The ASA ruled that the adverts were in breach of the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) code, which states that advertisements must not mislead consumers about the characteristics, ingredients, and efficacy of the advertised product. This ruling highlights the importance of transparency in advertising, ensuring that consumers are not misled into believing that ingredients or characteristics of a product are more significant than they actually are. It also shows the role that the ASA plays in investigating complaints and enforcing the codes of conduct for advertising in the UK. In response to the ruling, the brew company stated that they would ensure that their advertising is \\"clear and transparent\\" going forward. The footballer has not yet commented on the issue. Overall, the ruling serves as a reminder to advertisers to be mindful of their claims and to ensure that they accurately reflect the product they are promoting. It also reminds us all to be cautious when evaluating the claims made in advertisements, and to do our own research to ensure that the products we purchase live up to our expectations."},{"prompt":"Read this and answer the question.

Thus, a mixed marriage is forbidden as is the union of a horse and a donkey, and in both unions the offspring are judged matrilineally.

Fiftyfour percent of nonwhites say Wilson should be charged with murder, while 23% of whites hold that view. The poll is out Monday and is from CNN/ORC international.","completion":"A recent poll conducted by CNN/ORC international has found that there is a significant division between whites and non-whites when it comes to the issue of whether or not former police officer Darren Wilson should face murder charges. The poll, which was released on Monday, revealed that 54% of non-whites believe that Wilson should be charged with murder, while only 23% of whites hold the same view. This divide in opinion highlights the ongoing issue of racial tensions in America, particularly in relation to cases of police brutality and unjustified use of force against people of color. It is clear that there is a stark difference in how non-whites and whites view incidents where police officers are involved. While non-whites are more likely to believe that police officers should be held accountable for any unjust use of force, whites seem to be less likely to support such action. The case of Darren Wilson, who fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown in 2014, has garnered national attention and sparked protests and demonstrations across the country. While Wilson was not charged with murder, the incident has become a symbol of the systemic racism and bias that exists within law enforcement. The findings of this poll suggest that there is much work to be done in terms of creating a more equitable and just society, where everyone is treated fairly and without prejudice.

The study focused on the cognitive abilities of the wealthiest individuals in the world and analyzed their performance in various tasks that required critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making. The findings of the study are significant as they shed light on the contribution of cognitive abilities in attaining financial success. The study also challenges the notion that wealth accumulation is solely driven by factors such as luck, privilege, or inheritance. The study's lead author, Jonathan Wai, says that the results provide a valuable insight into the skills and abilities that are required for achieving financial success. Wai also adds that cognitive abilities play a crucial role in other areas of life and are essential for social mobility, job success, and academic performance. The study also found that most billionaires had an average IQ of 130, which is significantly higher than the average IQ of the general population. Furthermore, the study found that billionaires had a higher likelihood of being in the top one percent for other traits, such as creativity and openness to experience. However, the study does not offer a definitive explanation for why cognitive ability is related to wealth accumulation. It is possible that individuals with high cognitive ability are better equipped to identify opportunities and make decisions that result in greater financial success. Alternatively, they may be more adept at navigating complex financial systems and making profitable investments. Overall, the study highlights the importance of cognitive abilities in achieving financial success, and offers valuable insights into the skills and abilities required for success in other areas of life. The findings may also have implications for education and training programs, which may need to place greater emphasis on developing cognitive abilities to enhance overall student outcomes."},{"prompt":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Tom was not bothered by the dream.

It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

An antiterrorism strategy without diplomacy is a shortterm fix, President says. Obama presented a lawyerly defense of his foreign policy to date.","completion":"US Officials Question Yemen Military; President Rejects Short-Term Fixes The United States officials are deliberating the Yemeni military's ability to secure its territory amid growing threats from terrorist organizations – a task that is complicated by the country's civil war. Although the US has traditionally relied on Yemen as an ally in the fight against terrorism, the instability plaguing the country has left questions surrounding its ability to effectively combat the threat. “This is a country that has been going through a civil war now for several years, and it will take time for them to build up the capacity … to secure their own borders and their own territory,” said US Defense Secretary James Mattis. Despite the concerns surrounding Yemen's capability, President Obama warned against short-term strategies and argued the importance of diplomacy in any anti-terrorism efforts. The president defended his foreign policy, maintaining that a focus on diplomacy, in addition to military action, is essential in fighting terrorism in the long-term. “The notion that the answer to terrorism is to go ahead and deploy a larger military footprint, even if it may be temporarily effective, as an anti-terrorism strategy, is a mistake,” Obama said during a speech at the Pentagon. Instead, he urged the need for successful efforts in building international alliances and encouraging diplomatic solutions in order to focus on long-term solutions. Obama's defense of his foreign policy was described by many as \\"lawyerly,\\" as the President methodically laid out the longstanding challenges to U.S. national security, such as the war in Syria and the fight against ISIS. While emphasizing the importance of diplomatic and political solutions in resolving these issues, the President also stressed the need to stay vigilant with military tools to combat extremist threats. In the end, Obama’s message was clear: Diplomacy must be an essential component of the long-term strategy against terrorism. While acknowledging that there are no easy solutions to the global threat of terrorism faced by the United States, the President made a compelling case for a balance between military might and diplomatic finesse, in addition to maintaining an unwavering commitment to effectively thwarting terrorism in all its forms."},{"prompt":"Generate a short movie review that has positive sentiment.","completion":"\\"The movie was an absolute delight!

How Morgan Freeman's unnamed character psychically (not physically)arrives to where he meets this jaded checkout girl who has an unhealthy relationship with her current supervisor (who also happens to be getting it on with her philandering husband played by Bobby Cannavale in a small role) is somehow left for us to witness more than deduce and their witty banter two people on opposite sides of the coin of society is deceptively simple.

As such, many of the early Digimon—including Tyrannomon, the first one ever created—were based on dinosaurs. Many further designs were created by Kenji Watanabe, who was brought in to help with the XAntibody creatures and art for the Digimon collectible card game. Watanabe was one influenced by American comics, which were beginning to gain popularity in Japan, and as such began to make his characters look stronger and cool.

They move much more slowly than a mountain stream. These slow moving streams create different types of features than mountain streams. Slow moving water erodes the sides of their channels more than the bottom. Also, large curves in the stream form. These curves are called meanders. Meanders are caused by erosion and deposition. Remember, faster moving water causes erosion more quickly. Slower moving water erodes material more slowly. If water is moving slowly enough, the sediment being carried may settle out. This settling out, or dropping off, of sediment is deposition. The curves are called meanders because they slowly wander over the land. As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain. This is a broad, flat area on both sides of a river. Eventually, a meander may become cut off from the rest of the river. This forms an oxbow lake. Question: When does deposition occur?

Frederick himself lost half his army in the Battle of Kunersdorf , the worst defeat in his military career and one that drove him to the brink of abdication and thoughts of suicide.

Peter King has since come under fire for his comments on the case. King suggested that Garner's death was due to his pre-existing health conditions, which included asthma, a heart condition, and a weight of 350lbs. King argued that the police had \\"no reason\\" to know Garner was in danger, despite his pleas for help. King's comments have been criticized by many, including Garner's family and civil rights activists. They argue that Pantaleo's use of a chokehold was excessive force and violated Garner's civil rights. Pantaleo's actions were caught on video and showed him using a \\"banned chokehold\\" as he wrestled Garner to the ground. The case sparked nationwide protests and added to a growing public outcry over police brutality and excessive use of force against black Americans. Garner's death was one of several high-profile cases involving the death of a black person at the hands of police officers in recent years. Despite the controversy surrounding the case, no charges were ever filed against Pantaleo.

He also created the field of cellular automata without the aid of computers, constructing the first selfreplicating automata with pencil and graph paper. The concept of a universal constructor was fleshed out in his posthumous work Theory of Self Reproducing Automata. Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing largescale mining operations such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by using selfreplicating spacecraft, taking advantage of their exponential growth. His rigorous mathematical analysis of the structure of selfreplication (of the semiotic relationship between constructor, description and that which is constructed), preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA.

This team has developed what is called a robo-muscle, made of a special material called vanadium dioxide. This unique material has the ability to change its size, shape, and structure when exposed to heat, making it incredibly versatile and valuable for various applications. Vanadium dioxide has a very interesting property that makes it stand out from other materials: it acts as an insulator at low temperatures but becomes a conductor at 67 degrees Celsius. This property has long been known, but it was only recently discovered that it can produce a useful mechanical effect when the material contracts and expands. This makes vanadium dioxide an ideal material for creating a robo-muscle, which can mimic the movement of natural muscles and be controlled by heating and cooling. The implications of this breakthrough are significant. This discovery opens up new possibilities for more efficient electronic and optical devices. For example, vanadium dioxide could be used to create faster and more energy-efficient computer chips that can change states rapidly without the need for additional power. Additionally, it could be used to create smart windows that can transition from transparent to opaque with the flick of a switch. Overall, the development of vanadium dioxide robo-muscles by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory team is an exciting advancement in the field of materials science.

It is an indicator of the team's progress, both in terms of offense and defense. A short field goal means that the team was able to move the ball down the field and get close enough to the goal post to score, but also that they were unable to finish the drive and score a touchdown. Conversely, if the opposing team held them to a short field goal, it means they were able to prevent a touchdown and limit the damage. In the NFL, the current record for the shortest field goal in a game is 6 yards. This record was set on December 21, 1980, by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' Neil O'Donoghue in a game against the Miami Dolphins. The Buccaneers had driven down the field and stalled near the goal post, so O'Donoghue kicked the ball through the uprights for the shortest field goal in NFL history. However, it's important to note that this record is for regular-season games only. In the playoffs, the record for the shortest field goal is 9 yards, which has been accomplished twice. First by Don Cockroft in 1981 for the Cleveland Browns against the Oakland Raiders, and then by Ryan Longwell in 2004 for the Green Bay Packers against the Minnesota Vikings.

The Danish striker had been absent due to illness, but is now back and ready to get to work. However, before he can fully focus on his training, Bendtner will need to have a meeting with manager Arsene Wenger. It has been reported that Wenger will sit down with the player to discuss his behavior following last week's late-night dispute with a taxi driver. Bendtner has already stated that he will accept a fine for his actions and it appears that the club will not be taking any further disciplinary action.
