Though getting dehydrated you urinate more as body is 'out of whack' Dr Karl Kruszelnicki dispels myth that balancing loads of water with alcohol will make you less dehydrated.","completion":"Alcohol and Urination: Understanding the Science Behind It Alcohol consumption and urination are closely related, and it is essential to understand the science behind why we feel the urge to urinate after drinking alcohol. When we consume alcohol, our bladder holds up well until the third drink. After that, things start to change. Generally, the human body produces an anti-diuretic hormone, ADH, which stops us from urinating. However, when we consume alcohol, the brain doesn't produce much of this hormone. Instead, the kidneys start producing urine, and we end up visiting the restroom more frequently. Apart from this, volume also plays a crucial role. Social events involving alcohol generally have more alcohol than water. This means that we end up consuming more alcohol than our body can handle, leading to dehydration. When our body becomes dehydrated, we end up urinating excessively as our body is 'out of whack.' There is a popular myth that balancing alcohol with water will make you less dehydrated. However, this is not true. As per Dr. Karl Kruszelnicki, balancing water and alcohol doesn't change the fact that you are consuming more alcohol than what your body can handle. So, it's best to limit alcohol consumption and stay hydrated. In conclusion, alcohol and urination are closely associated, and understanding the science behind it can help us make better choices while consuming alcohol.

How can that be funny? Of course a character in a sitcom has to be flawed, but Jim's character is flawed in an extremely unsympathetic manner. And why it that? My guess is that it's because he should now better. Jim's not a stupid guy, he can take care of things and he's got the opportunities to do so. But he chooses not to. It's a conscious choice he makes, when he chooses to not play with his kids, not go shopping because he doesn't want to buy lady products and it's a choice he makes, when he puts down his relatives. The other characters seems to only be in the series so Jim can have someone to be a jerk to. If the Cheryl character was a real person, she would have left him years ago, and not stay with the deadbeat for 8 years. But alas, she's just a catalyst for Jim's quirky middleclass extreme selfishness. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?

It prepared a 450page report dated 15 May 1915. Although extensive discord amongst both officers and men of the 5th Light Infantry was identified, the cause of the mutiny was not conclusively established. The focus of the report was on possible external German influences, plus internal regimental causes of the mutiny.

Most soldiers killed were Muslims from the Hisar district and Rohtak district of current Haryana state of India. Nur Alam Shah was not put on trial, although he was exposed as an active Indian nationalist with links to Ghadar. Instead, he was detained and deported, as the British did not want to stir up trouble among their Muslim subjects.

Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason. Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the noncovariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard. The use of noncovariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by Erwin Schrodinger and others.

In this article, we will explore some of these crops and their significance in global agriculture. One of the most important crops that falls into this category is maize. In 2019, global production of maize was approximately 1.1 billion tons, with many countries producing more than 100 million tons each. However, there are still a significant number of countries where maize production falls between 10 and 100 thousand tons. These countries tend to be smaller and less developed, with less land available for agriculture. Another crop that falls into this category is sorghum. Sorghum is an important staple crop in many parts of Africa and Asia, where it is used for food, feed, and fuel. In 2019, global sorghum production was approximately 57 million tons, with a significant portion of this produced in countries such as India, Nigeria, and Sudan. However, there are also many smaller countries where sorghum production falls between 10 and 100 thousand tons. Other crops that fall into this category include barley, oats, and rye. These crops are widely grown in temperate regions and are used predominantly as animal feed. While these crops are not as widely consumed by humans as maize and sorghum, they play an important role in global agriculture by providing a valuable food source for livestock. In conclusion, there are a number of crops that produced between 10 and 100 thousand tons in 2019. While these crops may not be as widely grown as others such as maize and wheat, they still play an important role in global agriculture, particularly in smaller and less developed countries.

Some players have sought out contemporary composers to solicit new works. Traditional mandolin orchestras remain especially popular in Japan and Germany, but also exist throughout the United States, Europe and the rest of the world. They perform works composed for mandolin family instruments, or reorchestrations of traditional pieces.

According to data from public health departments in 2006, a higher number of African-Americans are affected by HIV/AIDS compared to other racial and ethnic groups. This disparity is a cause for concern, especially since HIV/AIDS can be prevented through education, testing, and treatment. It is crucial that healthcare providers and community organizations work towards bridging this gap and providing resources for prevention and treatment to African-American communities. One way to address this issue is through education and awareness campaigns. These campaigns can help debunk myths about HIV/AIDS and encourage individuals to get tested and seek treatment. Additionally, targeted interventions and outreach programs can be implemented to reach populations that are most affected by the disease. Furthermore, providing affordable access to healthcare and HIV/AIDS medications can greatly reduce the impact of the epidemic on African-American communities. Governments and healthcare providers can work towards ensuring that all individuals have equal access to these resources, regardless of their socio-economic status. Overall, the disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on African-American communities is a significant issue that requires attention and action from healthcare providers, community organizations, and government agencies.

This delicious rice is cooked using a unique process that involves parboiling the rice before it is dried and polished. This gives the rice a distinct flavor, texture and aroma. To cook South Indian-style parboiled rice, start by bringing two parts of water and a pinch of salt to a boil in a large pot. Once the water is boiling, add the rice to the pot and reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and simmer the rice for up to 45 minutes or until it is cooked through. It is important to note that South Indian-style parboiled rice takes longer to cook than regular white rice. This is because of the parboiling process, which partially cooks the rice before it is dried and polished. This also means that the rice retains more nutrients and vitamins than regular rice. Once the rice is cooked, remove it from the heat and let it sit for at least 5 minutes before fluffing it with a fork. This will help to redistribute the moisture in the rice and ensure that it is evenly cooked. South Indian-style parboiled rice pairs well with a variety of Indian dishes, including curries, dals, and biryanis. It also works well as a base for rice bowls or salads.

Like many people she is an endless dreamer, and she holds onto her dreams, never giving up. Even in the most adverse of situations, her dreams endure, and she won't let anyone take that away from her. Her example should serve as inspiration to everyone, and encouragement to never let go of your dreams. Would you say this review is positive or negative?

Rotation, as well as translations in space and time are basic symmetries of the laws of mechanics. They can, for instance, be used to construct simple models—imposing, say, axial symmetry on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a physical description.v[›] Another example are the Lorentz transformations, which relate measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other. They can be deduced in a purely grouptheoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of Minkowski space. The latter serves—in the absence of significant gravitation—as a model of space time in special relativity. The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e. including translations, is known as the Poincaré group. By the above, it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and, by implication, for quantum field theories.

Most notably, it caused disruptions for individuals and businesses that relied on the bridge for commuting and transporting goods. The closure resulted in longer commutes and increased transportation costs, leading to a reduction in trade between the two countries. Additionally, the closure of the Oresund Bridge had a psychological impact on the people living in the region.

The footage shows shoppers pushing and shoving each other to get their hands on the limited offer, with some even grabbing multiple cards to take advantage of the deal. While the rush for a good bargain is not uncommon, the scenes at Walmart have raised concerns about safety and the impact of these deals on consumer behavior. Experts have warned that the lure of deals can lead to impulsive buying and overspending, which can have a negative effect on financial stability. Furthermore, the chaos seen at Walmart highlights the risks of overcrowding and the need for better crowd management strategies, especially during peak shopping seasons. Despite the concerns, the Walmart deal was undoubtedly attractive, with shoppers keen to grab the chance to save money on their phone and internet bills.

Shopping around for the best deals and reading reviews from other customers can help avoid impulsive buying and ensure a better long-term deal.

If you're on ice, you'll need a sled designed for that surface, whereas a sled designed for snow will work better in those conditions. It's also important to wear a helmet when sledding, especially if you're going at higher speeds or on steeper hills. This will help protect your head in the event of a crash or collision. Next, choose a safe hill to sled on. It should be free of obstacles or hazards, and you should make sure there are no people or vehicles in the way before you start sledding. When you're ready to sled, make sure to sit facing forward and keep your hands and feet inside the sled at all times. This will help maintain stability and prevent any injuries from happening. Learning how to steer the sled is also important, as it can help you avoid obstacles or navigate around other people who may be sledding in the same area. Make sure to practice turning and maneuvering your sled in a safe and controlled manner. Finally, if you ever feel like you're losing control of the sled, it's important to bail out and get off the sled as quickly and as safely as possible. Don't try to hold onto the sled or regain control if it seems like it's going to cause injury or harm.

While wildfires are normal in California, the state's fires have generally gotten larger since 2000 as hotter and drier years go on record. That means warmed air is drawing water from soils and plants, making shrubs, trees, and grasslands more likely to burn. The summer dry season is also getting longer, letting plants get drier. We've been lengthening fire season by shortening the precipitation season, and we're warming throughout, says UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain. That's essentially what’s enabled these recent fires to be so destructive, at times of the year when you wouldn't really expect them. For more, including Fox News' take: Wet and dry: Climate change also brings high variations of rain and snowfall, making some years wet and others dry, per VOA News. That means more firestarting growth some years, and drier growth other years—perfect for a wildfire.","completion":"California Wildfires: The Role of Climate Change As California reels from yet another year of devastating wildfires, debate has raged between politicians and scientific experts regarding the cause of the fires. While President Trump has blamed the wildfires on poor forest management, National Geographic reports that climate change is also playing a role.

This is due to the warmer air drawing water from soils, shrubs, trees and grasslands, making them more likely to burn. Additionally, the summer season has grown dryer, allowing for plants to be more easily ignited.

Store your knives in a kitchen knife block. Keep your knife on a magnetic strip.","completion":"Proper Knife Storage: Knife Block or Magnetic Strip? Keeping your knives stored properly is not only important for convenience and organization, but for safety as well. Knives that are left loose in a drawer with other utensils can be dangerous and can damage both the blade and handle. There are two popular options for knife storage: a knife block or a magnetic strip. A kitchen knife block is a traditional option for storing knives. These blocks typically have slots for various sized knives, making it easy to grab the one you need. They can be made from various materials such as wood, bamboo, or acrylic. A knife block not only keeps your knives organized but also protects them from damage, especially if they have a blade cover or sheath. On the downside, knife blocks can take up counter space and can be difficult to clean and sanitize. Another option is a magnetic strip, which is mounted on the wall or installed underneath cabinets. A magnetic strip allows for easy access to your knives and takes up less counter space than a knife block. Additionally, it’s easy to clean and sanitize. However, a magnetic strip can sometimes be less secure, as knives can slip off the strip if not placed properly. It’s also important to note that the strip must be strong enough to hold the weight of your knives. Ultimately, the decision of whether to use a knife block or magnetic strip comes down to personal preference and how you use your kitchen. If you have limited counter space or want an easy-to-clean option, a magnetic strip may be the better choice for you. However, if you have a larger kitchen or prefer a more traditional storage option, a knife block may be the way to go. Regardless of which option you choose, always make sure to properly store your knives to ensure their longevity and safety."},{"prompt":"Planning has met with ENA on Tuesday and responded to the questions from ENA.

Add shine to heatdamaged hair. Add shine to thinning hair.","completion":"The desire for shiny, lustrous hair is universal, regardless of hair type or texture. Whether you have natural hair, color-treated hair, heat-damaged hair, or thinning hair, there are strategies that can help you achieve the glossy locks you're looking for. Adding Shine to Natural Hair: For those with natural hair, incorporating a few simple steps into your hair care routine can work wonders for enhancing shine. Start by washing your hair with a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo, followed by a moisturizing conditioner. Avoid using too much heat on your hair, such as blow drying or flat ironing, as this can strip your hair of its natural oils and dull the shine. Instead, use a diffuser or let your hair air-dry. In addition, consider applying a hair oil or serum to your hair while it's still damp, such as argan oil or coconut oil. These oils can penetrate the hair shaft and add an extra layer of shine without weighing down your hair. Adding Shine to Color-Treated Hair: Color-treated hair can be prone to dryness and damage, which can make it appear dull and lackluster. To add shine to your color-treated hair, start by using a color-safe shampoo and conditioner that's formulated to nourish and hydrate your hair. Try to avoid over-washing your hair, as this can further strip your hair of its natural oils. Additionally, incorporating a weekly hair mask or treatment can help restore moisture to your hair and enhance shine. Look for products that are specifically designed for color-treated hair and contain ingredients like keratin, argan oil, or avocado oil. Adding Shine to Heat-Damaged Hair: Heat damage can be a major culprit when it comes to hair that lacks shine. To add shine to your heat-damaged hair, start by minimizing your use of hot tools like curling irons or flat irons. When you must use heat, be sure to use a heat protectant spray or serum, which can help protect your hair from further damage. In addition, incorporating a weekly hair mask or treatment can help restore moisture to your hair and enhance shine. Look for products that contain ingredients like shea butter, jojoba oil, or honey, which can help nourish and repair damaged hair. Adding Shine to Thinning Hair: Thinning hair can be a challenge when it comes to achieving a glossy, shiny finish. However, there are strategies that can help. Start by using a volumizing shampoo and conditioner, which can help add body and fullness to your hair. Consider incorporating a hair serum or spray that's specifically designed for thinning hair, as these products can help add shine and enhance the appearance of your hair. Look for products that contain ingredients like biotin, collagen, or keratin, which can help strengthen and thicken your hair over time. In conclusion, whether you have natural hair, color-treated hair, heat-damaged hair, or thinning hair, there are strategies that can help you achieve the shiny, lustrous locks you're looking for. By incorporating a few simple steps into your hair care routine and choosing the right products, you can add shine and restore vitality to your hair."},{"prompt":"William C.

This was a result of seven reprimands handed down by newly elected mayor Earl Bullard. The investigation that led to Moore's dismissal began when she discovered that a city vehicle had been operated by Parks and Recreation Director Vontray Sellers with a suspended license. During this period, Moore also found out that Bullard had neglected to perform a proper background check on Sellers before offering him the job. Additionally, a recording of a phone call made by Bullard was leaked to the press. In that phone call, Bullard made several homophobic slurs. He stated that he would not allow \\"two women to stand up there and hold hands and let [his] child be aware of it,\\" and that he would not tolerate the same behavior from two men. The recording was provided to WBTW by council member Jared Taylor. The dismissal of Moore and the actions of Bullard have raised significant concerns among both citizens and government officials. There are questions about the propriety of Bullard's actions, particularly his lack of a background check on Sellers and his derogatory remarks about the LGBTQ+ community. Additionally, the Latta Police Department has lost an experienced and respected leader. Overall, the situation in Latta is a reminder of the importance of responsible and ethical leadership.

The mouth is surrounded by strong lips, which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass, leaves, and weeds, with bits of soil to help chew. The lips break the food down into smaller pieces. In the pharynx, the food is lubricated by mucus secretions for easier passage. The esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acids formed by food matter decay. Temporary storage occurs in the crop where food and calcium carbonate are mixed. The powerful muscles of the gizzard churn and mix the mass of food and dirt. When the churning is complete, the glands in the walls of the gizzard add enzymes to the thick paste, which helps chemically breakdown the organic matter. By peristalsis, the mixture is sent to the intestine where friendly bacteria continue chemical breakdown.

Transfer your credit card balance Consider student loan consolidation if you have multiple student loan payments.","completion":"One of the best ways to manage your finances effectively is to lower your interest rates as much as possible, and this can be achieved by following some basic steps. The first step is to call your credit card company and inquire about lower interest rates. Many people aren't aware that they can negotiate with credit card companies or even switch to the ones that offer lower interest rates until they ask. Another way to lower your interest rates is to transfer your credit card balance to another provider. You can do this by finding a provider that offers an introductory period with low or no interest rates. Be sure to read the terms and conditions carefully and do the math to ensure that you will be able to pay off the balance before the introductory period expires. If you have multiple student loan payments, consider consolidating them into one payment. This way, you will only have one payment to make each month, which could potentially be lower than the combined total of all your separate payments. Additionally, consolidating your student loans could also lower your interest rates, potentially saving you even more money in the long run. In conclusion, by taking these three steps, you can easily and effectively lower your interest rates and potentially save hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars over time. It may take a bit of time and effort, but the results will undoubtedly be worth it in the end."},{"prompt":"ere is a premise: I do, however, wonder about what is not there.

These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful broodrearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extrapair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extrapair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extrapair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.

Make art. Dance. Tell a story.","completion":"In today's fast-paced world, we often forget to take time for ourselves, to engage in activities that express our creativity and tell our unique stories. That's where the power of journaling comes in. By creating art, dancing, and telling stories, we tap into our innermost thoughts and feelings, allowing us to better understand ourselves and our place in the world. Journaling is a powerful tool for self-reflection and personal growth. It allows us to explore our thoughts and emotions, unraveling complex feelings and better understanding our reactions to the world around us. Whether it's through handwritten diary entries, bullet journaling, or scrapbooking, journaling can help us process our experiences, set goals, and envision a brighter future. Making art is another way to express ourselves and tap into our creativity. Whether we're painting, drawing, or crafting, creating something with our hands allows us to channel our emotions and release pent-up energy. Art can also act as a meditative practice, helping us to slow down and focus on the present moment. Dancing is yet another way to express ourselves and connect with our bodies. Moving to music allows us to let go of our inhibitions and express ourselves in a way that words cannot. Dance has also been shown to have numerous physical and mental health benefits, from improving cardiovascular health to reducing stress and anxiety. Finally, telling stories is one of the most powerful ways in which humans connect and communicate with each other. Whether we're sharing personal stories, folk tales, or fictional narratives, storytelling allows us to empathize with others and better understand their experiences.

Avicenna's astronomical writings had some influence on later writers, although in general his work could be considered less developed than Alhazen or AlBiruni. One important feature of his writing is that he considers mathematical astronomy as a separate discipline to astrology. He criticized Aristotle's view of the stars receiving their light from the Sun, stating that the stars are selfluminous, and believed that the planets are also selfluminous. He claimed to have observed Venus as a spot on the Sun. This is possible, as there was a transit on May 24, 1032, but Avicenna did not give the date of his observation, and modern scholars have questioned whether he could have observed the transit from his location at that time; he may have mistaken a sunspot for Venus. He used his transit observation to help establish that Venus was, at least sometimes, below the Sun in Ptolemaic cosmology, i.e. the sphere of Venus comes before the sphere of the Sun when moving out from the Earth in the prevailing geocentric model.

Do an aerobic exercise. Take a nap. Laugh. Unload with journaling.","completion":"Taking care of both our physical and mental health is crucial in leading a happy and fulfilling life. With the fast-paced nature of modern society, it's easy to overlook the importance of self-care. However, achieving a healthy balance is possible by incorporating simple habits like going outside, aerobic exercise, taking a nap, laughing, and journaling. Going outside can have an incredible impact on our mental health. Whether it's taking a walk, sitting in a park, or simply enjoying some fresh air, nature has a way of calming us down and reducing stress. The sunshine and natural surroundings boost our mood and promote the release of endorphins, which make us feel happier. Aerobic exercise is another way of improving our health. It doesn't have to be anything too intense or complicated – jogging, dancing, or cycling are all great options. Aerobic exercise helps lower blood pressure, improves heart health, and releases endorphins. It also helps us maintain a healthy weight and reduces the risk of developing chronic illnesses. Taking a nap can be a helpful way to rejuvenate our body and mind. A short nap of 20-30 minutes can help improve our mood and focus levels, leading to greater productivity in the long run. Napping also helps our bodies recover from tiredness, which is particularly beneficial for those who work long hours. Laughter is truly the best medicine. It releases endorphins which enhance our mood and reduce stress hormones. It is easy to incorporate laughter into our everyday lives – whether it's watching a funny sitcom, spending time with friends, or reading a humorous book, laughing is a great way to lift our spirits. Finally, journaling is a fantastic tool for unloading our thoughts and emotions. Often, it can be difficult to talk about our feelings to someone else, but writing them down can be an incredibly useful outlet. Journaling provides a way for us to express our ideas, worries, and hopes, without fear of judgment or consequences. It can also help us identify patterns in our thought processes, which can lead to greater self-awareness. In conclusion, taking care of oneself is essential to leading a fulfilling life. Incorporating simple habits like going outside, aerobic exercise, taking a nap, laughing, and journaling can have immense benefits for our mental and physical health. By prioritizing self-care, we can improve our relationship with ourselves, leading to greater confidence and happiness overall."},{"prompt":"Try 10 (yay, the price makes it tempting) make your own pizza if you want to taste undercooked flour.

Alex Salmond was ridiculed for claiming to have EU legal advice before admitting he had not.","completion":"In a recent speech to MPs, Hugo Swire stated that if Scotland were to become independent, they would have to \\"start afresh.\\" This comment comes before the upcoming vote in 2014, where Scots will decide whether to stay part of the United Kingdom or become their sovereign nation. The potential consequences of independence are vast and complex, ranging from the economic impact of losing the UK's support to the question of Scottish citizenship. If voters choose to leave the Union, they will have to establish their own policies and agreements on key issues, such as trade and security. One aspect of independence that has caused controversy is the question of Scotland's place in the European Union. The SNP has claimed that Scotland would remain a member of the EU, but this assertion has been met with skepticism. This was heightened when Alex Salmond claimed to have legal advice confirming Scotland's EU status, but later admitted that this was not the case. The question of Scotland's EU membership is a vital one, as it has the potential to affect the peaceful relations between Scotland and the rest of the UK. Some have even argued that if an independent Scotland were to reapply for EU membership, the UK might block its bid out of spite. While some argue that Scotland would be better off as an independent nation, the risks involved cannot be underestimated. Swire's warning that Scotland would have to \\"start afresh\\" is a reminder that independence would not be an easy road, and that any decision made by the Scottish public will have to be backed up by careful deliberation and a clear plan of action."},{"prompt":"The Ivy League is a collegiate athletic conference comprising sports teams from eight private institutions of higher education in the Northeastern United States.

Beneficiaries include Somalia, Sudan and even Kim Jongun's North Korea. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"The UK government has come under fire for providing aid to some of the world's most corrupt regimes. A recent study has revealed that out of the 20 most corrupt countries, all but one receive aid from the UK. Even more concerning is that the aid provided to the worst offenders actually rose by almost a quarter in 2013 compared to the previous year. The beneficiaries of this aid package include countries such as Somalia, Sudan, and even North Korea, which is run by the well-known dictator Kim Jong-un. Many critics are arguing that providing aid to these corrupt regimes does little to help the local population and only serves to prop up the ruling class. Moreover, the study's findings raise serious questions about the UK government's allocation of resources and whether it truly prioritizes aid to those who need it the most. With limited resources available, it is essential that aid is directed towards those countries where it can have the greatest impact. This issue is further exacerbated by the fact that corruption often leads to economic stagnation and poverty. This means that the aid provided to these countries may not have the desired effect, as corrupt officials may siphon off some of the funds for their own benefit. Ultimately, it is crucial that the UK government re-evaluates its approach to foreign aid and ensures that it is being allocated where it can make the greatest impact. This is not only important for the local populations who are in need of assistance, but also for UK taxpayers who deserve to know that their money is being used effectively."},{"prompt":"Static electricity is like a teetertotter.
