If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. Communism remained an important focus especially during the 1950s and 1960s. Colonialism and racism were important issues that arose. In general, there was a marked trend towards a pragmatic approach to political issues, rather than a philosophical one. Much academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics: how (or whether) to apply utilitarianism to problems of political policy, or how (or whether) to apply economic models (such as rational choice theory) to political issues. The rise of feminism, LGBT social movements and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as African Americans and sexual minorities in the developed world has led to feminist, postcolonial, and multicultural thought becoming significant.

However, Jordan quickly backtracked on this statement, instead labeling the president a \\"hack.\\" President Obama, who has conceded that Jordan is a better golfer than him, fired back in good humor, suggesting that Jordan may want to focus on the struggling Hornets instead of playing golf. The president, who has a handicap of 18, has played an impressive 200 rounds of golf since taking office. Despite the lighthearted banter between the two, the topic of the president's golfing habits has sparked controversy in the past. Critics claim that Obama's frequent rounds of golf are unbecoming of the presidency, while supporters argue that he deserves some leisure time like any other person. Regardless of where you stand on the issue, it is undeniable that President Obama is a passionate golfer. He has even been known to hit the links with other political leaders, using the game as a chance to build relationships and relax outside of the office.

These plants have a low water requirement, and they only need a thorough soaking every few weeks. If they are planted outdoors, you can wait even longer to water them, depending on natural rainfall.

Will Pascoe fails utterly in this effort, cobbling together uninspired snippets of Chomsky's wisdom from a visit to McMaster University in Hamilton. The footage is shot amateurishly and in video.

Raptor hunting is a popular pastime in Scotland, where falconers train birds such as hawks and eagles to hunt prey. However, even the most trained birds are not always safe in the wild, as this recent incident shows. The captive eagle was hunting with its owner when it encountered a male golden eagle. The two birds clashed, with the tamed eagle managing to fend off the wild intruder. However, the victory was short-lived, as a larger female golden eagle soon appeared on the scene.

Step 1: Prepare a Clean Bucket It's best to use a bucket that has only been used for aquarium-related tasks to avoid contamination. Fill the bucket with tap water and ensure that it's at room temperature. Step 2: Add a Dechlorinator Most tap water contains chlorine, which can harm your fish if not treated.

Follow the instructions on the product to ensure the correct dosage, based on the amount of water in the bucket. Step 3: Pour the Treated Water Into the Tank Gradually Using the bucket, gradually add the treated water to the tank. It's vital to do this slowly to avoid shocking your goldfish with sudden changes in temperature or water quality. Slowly pour the water into the tank, aiming for the area around the filter to circulate the water quickly. Step 4: Turn Your Tank Equipment Back On Once you've refilled the tank with treated water, turn on the equipment, including the filter, heater, and air pump.

Pin the loops into the dress. Sew the opening back shut. Lace the dress.","completion":"This article will guide you through making lacing loops for your dress. The first step is to obtain material for the lacing loops. You can use ribbon, bias tape, or any other suitable fabric. Cut the material into a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide strip using a pair of sharp scissors. Make sure the edges are straight and even. Next, place the strip of fabric right side down on your sewing machine and sew using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. Be sure to backstitch at the beginning and end of every stitch line. Sew the entire length of the strip, leaving both ends open. Once the strip is sewn, you can turn it right-side-out. Use a turning tool or a small tool like a chopstick to carefully turn the fabric inside out. It may take a little bit of patience, but be gentle to avoid tearing the fabric. Now that the strip is turned right-side-out, cut it into short segments. The length here will depend on how many loops you will need for your dress. Usually, four or more loops are sufficient. Make sure each loop is of equal length. Using pins, attach the lacing loops to your dress. Start by pinning one end of the loop to the inside of the dress, near the edge of the opening where the lacing will go. Then, pin the other end of the loop to the opposite side of the opening, again near the edge. Once the loops are all pinned in place, you can sew the opening shut. Use a matching thread and sew as close to the edge as possible. Be sure to remove the pins as you go. Finally, lace up your dress using the loops you have just made. Take the end of the lacing material and thread it through one loop, then cross it over and thread it through the opposite loop. Continue lacing up the dress this way until you reach the top. Congratulations, your dress now has beautiful lacing loops!"},{"prompt":"TheprincipleoftheMegaMillionsgameistohitfivenumbersfrom1to75andhitoneadditionalnumberfrom1to15Numbers1to75arewhiteballs,thenumbersfrom1to15ofthegoldenballs.Onelotterynumberfrom1to75iscalledtheMegaBall.HittingallthosenumberswinsthejackpotinMegaMillions,anditisatleast12million.

It has been reported that a student named Mundill Mahil, who was then 20 years old, was behind the motive for this heinous crime. Mahil allegedly got two men to take revenge on Singh, who she claimed had sexually assaulted her. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Singh actually committed any such offense. The two men, Harvinder Shoker and Darren Peters, were found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison in 2012. Mahil was also found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 6 years in prison. She was subsequently released on parole after serving half her sentence. This incident highlights the dangers of taking revenge into one's own hands and the importance of due process of law. It is crucial to be vigilant in pursuing justice while also ensuring that innocent people are not wrongly accused or punished. Furthermore, it also sheds light on the issue of sexual assault and how accusations should be taken seriously but must also be investigated thoroughly to ensure that justice is served for both the alleged victims and the accused. It is vital to address the issue of sexual assault in a fair and just manner without resorting to vigilante actions.

Modern Paris owes much to its late 19th century Second Empire remodelling by the Baron Haussmann: many of modern Paris' busiest streets, avenues and boulevards today are a result of that city renovation. Paris also owes its style to its aligned streetfronts, distinctive creamgrey Paris stone building ornamentation, aligned topfloor balconies, and treelined boulevards.

Aircraft launch forward, into the wind, and are recovered from astern. The flight deck is where the most notable differences between a carrier and a land runway are found. Creating such a surface at sea poses constraints on the carrier – for example, the fact that it is a ship means that a fulllength runway would be costly to construct and maintain. This affects takeoff procedure, as a shorter runway length of the deck requires that aircraft accelerate more quickly to gain lift. This either requires a thrust boost, a vertical component to its velocity, or a reduced takeoff load (to lower mass). The differing types of deck configuration, as above, influence the structure of the flight deck. The form of launch assistance a carrier provides is strongly related to the types of aircraft embarked and the design of the carrier itself. What is a primary reason that ships have longer runways than land runways have? (If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable)","completion":"The statement provided is incorrect. Ships, specifically aircraft carriers, do not have longer runways than land runways.

GCHQ and the National Crime Agency are at the forefront of this effort, using digital fingerprints on dark net areas to identify paedophiles and bring them to justice. Prime Minister David Cameron has stated that the unit will \\"shine a light\\" on the most nefarious corners of the web. As part of the effort, tech giants Google and Facebook are launching new technology to combat the spread of child pornography. The tools being developed will allow these companies to detect and report any images that are uploaded or shared that match known illegal content. This will help stop the spread of this abhorrent material and make it harder for paedophiles to access it in the first place. The use of digital fingerprints allows investigators to track down those who use hidden services, which are specifically designed to keep users anonymous. These services can be accessed only by using special software, which means that it's extremely difficult for law enforcement to identify those who use them. However, by using digital fingerprints, law enforcement agencies are able to piece together the networks and catch those who use them for illegal purposes. This approach has already proved successful, with law enforcement agencies around the world using digital fingerprints to track down paedophiles on the dark net. As technology continues to develop, it's expected that we will see more and more successful prosecutions of those who use the dark net to distribute illegal content. In conclusion, the use of digital fingerprints and new technology is a promising development in the fight against child pornography on the dark net. By shining a light on the web's darkest corners and deploying the latest tools, we can make the internet a safer place for everyone.

This might happen because of heavy rains. Floodplains In very flat regions, flood water may spread out on the surface of the land. It then slows down and drops its sediment.

Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert.

Though there are many methods to remove a splinter, some may not always work for everyone. Here are a few solutions to examine: Firstly, take a close look at the splinter. If it is visible, try using a pair of tweezers to gently pull it out in the direction it entered the skin. Be careful not to break the splinter and push it further into the skin. If the splinter is not visible, try using tape to remove it. Place a piece of tape over the area and press down firmly, then gently pull the tape off in the opposite direction of the splinter’s entry. The tape should pull the splinter along with it. Another solution is to use glue. Apply a small amount of glue to the affected area, and let it dry. Once dried, gently pull the glue off, and the splinter should come out with it. Baking soda can also help in removing a splinter. Mix a small amount of baking soda with water to create a paste, and apply it to the area. Cover it with a bandage or let it dry, then remove the bandage or dried paste to expose the splinter, which should be easier to remove now. Another option is ichthammol ointment. Apply a small amount of the ointment to the area, and cover it with a bandage. Allow time for it to seep into the skin, and once you remove the bandage, the splinter will be more visible and easier to remove. Lastly, epsom salts can be used to treat the affected area. Mix a small amount of epsom salts with water to create a paste, and apply it to the area. Let it dry for a couple of hours before removing it, and the splinter should naturally come out. In conclusion, removing a splinter can be a frustrating experience, but with these methods, you can find a solution that works for you.

Check to see if the trinomial is a perfect square. Check whether no solution exists.","completion":"When working with mathematical problems, there are often different checks we need to perform to ensure our solutions are accurate. Three important checks to use in problem-solving are checking for prime numbers, checking if the trinomial is a perfect square, and checking if no solution exists. Firstly, checking for prime numbers is crucial when dealing with factors or multiples. A prime number is a number that is divisible only by 1 and itself. By checking if a number is prime, we can determine if it has any other factors or is a multiple of another number. This check can help us simplify and reduce fractions, factorize equations, or determine if an equation has any solutions. Secondly, checking if a trinomial is a perfect square is essential when working with quadratic equations. A perfect square trinomial is a quadratic equation that can be factored into two identical brackets. This check can help simplify complicated quadratic expressions and determine whether an equation has any rational solutions. If a trinomial is not a perfect square, it may require complex roots or may have no real solutions. Lastly, checking whether no solution exists is a critical step in verifying the correctness of our solutions. Sometimes, no solution exists for a problem, and this check is necessary to avoid any mathematical errors. For example, if we are solving an equation with two variables and after substitution, we end up with an impossible equation, we can conclude that no solutions exist. This check can help avoid illogical answers or nonsensical results. In conclusion, by using these checks in our problem-solving process, we can ensure that our solutions are accurate and logical. Checking for prime numbers, perfect square trinomials, and the possibility of no solution can significantly simplify complex mathematical problems and reduce the likelihood of errors."},{"prompt":"Please answer this question: who did the seahawks play in the super bowl?","completion":"The Seahawks played against the Patriots in the Super Bowl."},{"prompt":"Solve 19*b + 11 = 11 for b.","completion":"First, we can isolate the variable b on one side of the equation by adding 19b to both sides: -19b + 11 + 19b = 11 + 19b Simplifying the left side of the equation gives: 11 = 11 + 19b We can then simplify the right side by subtracting 11 from both sides: 0 = 19b Finally, we can solve for b by dividing both sides by 19: b = 0/19 b = 0 Therefore, the solution is b = 0."},{"prompt":"WiththeFrenchRevolutioncamealiberationofthearts,whichJuelhadwitnessedduringhismanyyearstravellingabroad,andhewasthereforeabletoliveuptothe,forthetime,moderndemandsandexpectationsofart,whichwerealsoemerginginDenmark.Interestintheprivatesphere,familybonds,andthefreerexpressiongrantedtochildrenweretendenciesthatwerepopularatthetimeandaredepictedinthepainting.

After soaking, rinse and dry the stamps carefully on a paper towel or drying book. This process will further prevent damage to your stamps by removing any dirt, dust, or grime that might be attached to them. For self-adhesive stamps, a simple trick is to use air freshener to remove them from the envelope. Simply spray a small amount of air freshener onto the back of the stamp and wait for it to loosen before carefully peeling it off.

It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest.

Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing the volume of the cavity in which the lung is enclosed. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities; it flows through the larynx, trachea and bronchi and expands the alveoli. Relaxation of the diaphragm has the opposite effect, passively recoiling during normal breathing. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing visceral pressure on the diaphragm, thus forcing the air out more quickly and forcefully. The rib cage itself also is able to expand and contract the thoracic cavity to some degree, through the action of other respiratory and accessory respiratory muscles. As a result, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung as it resembles a blacksmith's bellows.

He founded two newspapers: one for the troops in his army and another for circulation in France. The royalists attacked Bonaparte for looting Italy and warned that he might become a dictator. All told, Napoleon's forces extracted an estimated 45 million in funds from Italy during their campaign there, another 12 million in precious metals and jewels; atop that, his forces confiscated more than threehundred priceless paintings and sculptures. Bonaparte sent General Pierre Augereau to Paris to lead a coup d'état and purge the royalists on 4 September—Coup of 18 Fructidor. This left Barras and his Republican allies in control again but dependent on Bonaparte, who proceeded to peace negotiations with Austria. These negotiations resulted in the Treaty of Campo Formio, and Bonaparte returned to Paris in December as a hero. He met Talleyrand, France's new Foreign Minister—who later served in the same capacity for Emperor Napoleon—and they began to prepare for an invasion of Britain.

Within a few minutes, the bread usually turns rubbery and even tougher than before. This is the fastest method, but it's best to save it for an immediate snack. This happens because the microwave boils away some of the water. The escaping steam pushes the starches into a denser structure, and leaves the bread dry.

To overcome the damage caused by the silent treatment, it is essential to address the issue head-on. It is advisable to vent one's feelings clearly, without blaming the other person. Instead, the focus should be on how the actions or words of the person affected you emotionally. By doing this, you emphasize the underlying issue and create a platform for a constructive discussion. It is essential to work together towards a compromise that will benefit both parties. Providing a fix for the problem will help prevent the situation from resurfacing in the future. It is critical also to employ active listening techniques and recognize the other person's perspective. Understanding each other's views will create a more profound sense of mutual respect and esteem in the relationship.

Acknowledging your part in a misunderstanding or conflict can signify your willingness to make amends and rebuild the relationship.

Every bit of experience you gain will help shape your skills and build your resume. Don’t be afraid to start small and work your way up. Once you have begun to gain some experience, it is important to get an agent. An agent can help you find auditions and negotiate contracts on your behalf. However, be cautious in choosing an agent and do your research to make sure they have a good reputation and are a good fit for you. Networking is also crucial in Hollywood. Attend industry events, meet and greet with other industry professionals, and make connections wherever you can. Building relationships with other performers, agents, managers, and casting directors can lead to valuable opportunities. Perhaps one of the hardest aspects of pursuing a career in Hollywood is dealing with rejection. As a performer, it is easy to become discouraged when you don’t get the role you auditioned for.
