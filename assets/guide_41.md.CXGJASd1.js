Separate lowvoltage transformer windings supply lighting and the motors driving auxiliary machinery. More recently, the development of very high power semiconductors has caused the classic universal AC/DC motor to be largely replaced with the threephase induction motor fed by a variable frequency drive, a special inverter that varies both frequency and voltage to control motor speed. These drives can run equally well on DC or AC of any frequency, and many modern electric locomotives are designed to handle different supply voltages and frequencies to simplify crossborder operation. How can different range of voltages be supplied for AC locomotives?","completion":"Multiple taps on the transformer can supply a range of voltages for AC locomotives."},{"prompt":"What are the keywords in the following sentence: christmas ornaments hanging on red ribbon under the inscription .","completion":"Christmas ornaments, red ribbon, inscription."},{"prompt":"Add punctuation: In the SpyHunter Settings panel you will be able to control and configure the advanced Scan Scheduler which enables automatic preset daily weekly monthly intervals scanning even when you are away from your computer","completion":"In the SpyHunter Settings panel, you will be able to control and configure the advanced Scan Scheduler, which enables automatic preset daily, weekly, and monthly intervals scanning, even when you are away from your computer."},{"prompt":"Continue writing the next sentence.

The entire incident was captured on a camera mounted on the handlebars. This kind of accident is known as being “doored” and it is so common in Melbourne that it is now considered an offense punishable by a fine of 350. After the incident, the cyclist demanded that the male passengers give her their details. However, they refused and started to verbally abuse her before walking away. The cyclist then pursued them. This kind of behavior is unacceptable, especially when one considers that the cyclist was the victim in this situation. It is important that more people become aware of the dangers posed by opening a door without looking for cyclists that may be approaching from behind. While the law does offer consequences for those who “door” cyclists, it is crucial for people to take their safety seriously and to be more mindful of their actions when exiting a vehicle. Cycling is a popular mode of transportation in many cities around the world, and cyclists have the same rights to use the road as other vehicles. However, without proper safety measures in place, accidents like this will continue to occur.

Fans eagerly await to see which team and which player will score the initial points. In some cases, the player who scores the opening points is remembered for years to come. However, determining who scored the first points of a game can sometimes be tricky. In the modern era of basketball, various outlets track player statistics and scores, making it easy to identify the first scorer. However, for games that took place decades ago, uncovering such information may require some detective work. In general, the identity of the first scorer depends on the game and the specific competition. For example, during an NBA game, the opening basket is typically announced by the team’s public address announcer, who will name the player and the scorer's method (e.g., a two-pointer or a three-pointer). The same goes for top-level college basketball games, where the opening basket is confirmed by the game officials and subsequently recorded in the official box score. For lower-level or less formal competitions, tracking the first scorer can be a bit more challenging. In many such situations, the scorer may not be recorded at all, or the record may be incomplete or inaccurate. In some cases, the scorer may not have been announced, and there may be no official record to consult. In conclusion, determining who scored the first points of a basketball game can vary depending on the competition and the available records. In general, in modern basketball games, the opening scorer is typically announced by the public address announcer or confirmed by game officials and subsequently recorded in the official box score. For older or less formal competitions, discovering the scorer may require a bit of detective work and is not always guaranteed."},{"prompt":"ere is some data about a restaurant: name = Fitzbillies, eatType = restaurant, food = Japanese, priceRange = £2025, near = The Six Bells.

We would then compare the number of touchdown passes each quarterback has thrown in that timeframe. The quarterback with the higher number of touchdowns would be considered the one who threw more touchdowns. It's important to keep in mind that touchdown statistics can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the quality of the team's offense, the skill of the receivers, and the quarterback's overall performance. Therefore, the number of touchdowns thrown shouldn't be the only factor used to evaluate a quarterback's performance.

After the war, the few surviving domesticated quail were used to rebuild the industry, and all current commercial and laboratory lines are considered to have originated from this population. Modern birds can lay upward of 300 eggs a year and countries such as Japan, India, China, Italy, Russia, and the United States have established commercial Japanese quail farming industries. Japanese quail are also used in biomedical research in fields such as genetics, embryology, nutrition, physiology, pathology, and toxicity studies.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. Capacitors, especially ceramic capacitors, and older designs such as paper capacitors, can absorb sound waves resulting in a microphonic effect.

The resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording. In the reverse microphonic effect, the varying electric field between the capacitor plates exerts a physical force, moving them as a speaker.

For example, in the case of the few countries that adopted the reformed calendar on the date proposed by Gregory XIII for the calendar's adoption, Friday, 15 October 1582, the preceding date was Thursday, 4 October 1582 (Julian calendar).

The video was posted online after Ireland's win against the USA last Tuesday. However, the song has sparked controversy due to its ties to the Irish Republican Army (IRA). The song was written in honor of Joe McDonnell, a member of the Provisional IRA who died on hunger strike in 1981. The IRA is a paramilitary organization that has been involved in a decades-long armed struggle for the unification of Ireland. The song has lyrics that some have interpreted as glorifying violent revolution and calls to arms. Following the release of the video, Delaney faced condemnation from politicians and members of the public. However, he has since apologized for any offense caused by his singing of the song. In a statement, Delaney said, \\"I am not a violent person, and I apologize if anyone is offended by the song. It was a mistake to sing it, and I regret it.\\" The incident has once again raised questions about the role of politics and sport. In recent years, there has been an increased focus on the use of sports events to make political statements or to highlight social issues. Many people argue that sports should be kept separate from politics, while others believe that sports can be a powerful tool for promoting social change. Regardless of where one stands on this debate, it is clear that Delaney's actions have caused offense to many. It is commendable that he has apologized for his mistake, and the incident serves as a reminder to all of us that our actions and words can have unintended consequences. As we move forward, we must be mindful of the impact that our actions have on others and strive to act in a way that is respectful and inclusive."},{"prompt":"What are the keywords in the following sentence: aerial shot of the green meadow under blue sky with clouds .","completion":"The keywords in the sentence are: aerial shot, green meadow, blue sky, clouds."},{"prompt":"Viru is a 5.0% ABV pilsnerstyle beer brewed in Estonia.

The Nationals MP's controversial remarks caused a backlash on social media, with many labeling the comments as \\"disgraceful and shameful.\\" Despite the criticism, Christensen remained unrepentant, stating that \\"sometimes truth hurts.\\" However, the situation took a dark turn when Christensen reported receiving a death threat to the police. He blamed opposition leader Bill Shorten for \\"fanning this violence,\\" adding more fuel to the already controversial situation. It is never acceptable to suggest that people should leave their country because they have complaints. As a representative of the people, it's important for politicians to listen to the concerns of their constituents and work towards finding solutions. These remarks do nothing to address the issues raised. Moreover, the decision to blame someone else for the death threat is alarming. It's essential to take this type of threat seriously and work with law enforcement to find the perpetrators. However, blaming someone with different political views does nothing to address the root cause of the problem. In conclusion, politicians must exercise restraint and sensitivity when making public statements. George Christensen's remarks and subsequent actions were not helpful and only served to inflame an already tense situation.

He has stated that Russia should not be allowed to host the event given the current political climate.

When hunger is not an issue, in general most predators will not seek to attack prey since the costs outweigh the benefits. For instance, a large predatory fish like a shark that is well fed in an aquarium will typically ignore the smaller fish swimming around it (while the prey fish take advantage of the fact that the apex predator is apparently uninterested). Surplus killing represents a deviation from this type of behaviour. The treatment of consumption in terms of costbenefit analysis is known as optimal foraging theory, and has been quite successful in the study of animal behavior. In general, costs and benefits are considered in energy gain per unit time, though other factors are also important, such as essential nutrients that have no caloric value but are necessary for survival and health.

Some believe the vigilante group actually supports another cartel, New Generation, which has been involved in a turf war with the Knights Templar.

Whether it's because the topic is uncomfortable or we simply have other obligations to attend to, it's important to know how to gracefully excuse ourselves from a conversation. One way to do this is to simply be vague about the reason you need to leave. You can say something like, \\"Excuse me, I need to attend to something\\" or \\"I have some other business to attend to\\" without going into specifics about what that business is. This allows you to exit the conversation without making the other person feel uncomfortable or unimportant. Another option is to set clear boundaries from the start of the conversation. If you know that you have limited time to spare, you can politely let the other person know that you're only available for a short while. This gives them the opportunity to get to the point quickly and allows you to exit the conversation without feeling guilty. If you find yourself in a situation where you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, it's important to know how to call for help. Excusing yourself to make a phone call or to get help from someone nearby can help you to avoid a potentially dangerous situation.

One solution that has become increasingly popular is virtual dates. This may seem daunting at first, but with a little preparation, virtual dates can be just as enjoyable as in-person ones. The first step to a successful virtual date is to agree on a time and platform. This could be anything from Zoom to FaceTime, but it's important to make sure both parties are comfortable with the chosen platform. Once you've decided on a time and platform, treat the date like you would an in-person one. Get dressed up the way you normally would, and make sure to tidy up the space where you'll be chatting. It's also important to make sure your device is charged and plugged in before the date begins. There's nothing worse than a device dying halfway through a conversation. Once everything is set up, give your date your full attention. This means no multitasking or checking your phone. Treat the virtual date just as you would an in-person one in terms of attentiveness. If you want to share a meal, consider ordering take-out from the same restaurant so you can both enjoy the same type of cuisine. Alternatively, you could cook the same recipe separately and enjoy the meal together virtually. Sharing a meal can help create a sense of togetherness during the date. Another fun virtual date idea is to stream a movie together. There are several platforms available that allow you to watch a movie simultaneously, so you can still have that shared movie experience. You could also try an online workout class together, which is a fun and active way to bond. Lastly, playing an online game together can be a great way to break the ice and have some fun. Whether it's a trivia game or a multiplayer game, playing together can help bring out your competitive side and provide some laughs along the way. In summary, virtual dates require some preparation, but with a little creativity and effort, they can be just as fun and fulfilling as in-person dates. Agree on a time and platform, get dressed up, tidy up your space, give your date your full attention, consider sharing a meal, stream a movie or workout class, and play an online game together. These tips will help ensure a successful and enjoyable virtual date."},{"prompt":"What happens next? How to connect to your pc remotely in windows 8 Set up your router.

The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is political ecology. Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, and more. The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land.

Enjoy!","completion":"Age the brew—briefly! Enjoy! When it comes to brewing, time is an essential factor that can greatly influence the flavor of your beer, wine or other fermented beverages. Many homebrewers, especially those new to the hobby, believe that the longer you let your brew age, the better it will taste. While this may be true in some cases, it's not always the best approach. First of all, every type of beverage has its perfect aging window. For example, beer typically tastes best when consumed fresh, within a few weeks to a few months after bottling. On the other hand, wine usually needs to be aged for several months to even several years to develop its complex flavors and aromas. While aging can undoubtedly enhance the taste and aroma of your beverage, it's good to remember that it's not always a good thing. Over-aging can cause your brew to lose its carbonation, flavor, and aroma, leaving it flat and lifeless. Furthermore, not all beverages are suitable for aging, and some may spoil or turn sour if kept for too long. So, what's the best approach? The answer is to age your brew briefly but not for too long. This means that you should respect the aging window of your beverage and consume it while it's still at its peak. After that, the flavor and aroma may start to degrade. But how can you tell if your brew is still good or not? The simplest way is to taste it regularly as it ages. This way, you can monitor its flavor and aroma and learn when it's time to drink it. If you notice that the flavor and aroma are starting to degrade, it's time to consume it before it loses its freshness entirely. In conclusion, while aging your brew can enhance its flavor and aroma, over-aging can do more harm than good. Therefore, it's best to age your brew briefly within its optimal aging window and enjoy it while it's at its best. By doing so, you'll ensure that you get the most out of your brewing efforts and enjoy a delicious, refreshing beverage that's perfect for any occasion."},{"prompt":"Read this: Holes through a PCB are typically drilled with smalldiameter drill bits made of solid coated tungsten carbide. Coated tungsten carbide is recommended since many board materials are very abrasive and drilling must be high RPM and high feed to be cost effective.

Speaking to the media ahead of their Premier League match against Watford, Van Gaal acknowledged that he was still in the process of building a team that could challenge for major trophies, and that he had to balance the needs of experienced and young players in the squad. \\"I don't have any worries about Wayne,\\" Van Gaal said. \\"He's a multi-functional player, and he has played as a striker, as a midfielder, and as a captain. But I have to look at the balance of the team and the performance level of the players, not just their reputation or their position.\\" Rooney, who turns 30 this month, has played 11 of United's 12 league games this season, scoring twice and providing four assists. However, his performances in the attacking midfield role have been mixed, with some games showcasing his vision, creativity, and work rate, while others revealing his lack of pace, precision, and influence. Van Gaal hinted that he may have other options to consider if the team needed a change. \\"We have a lot of competition for places now in the midfield,\\" he said. \\"We have Ander Herrera, who has played well for us recently, and also Morgan Schneiderlin, who can provide more balance and control in front of the back four. And then there's Bastian Schweinsteiger, who has the experience and the quality to lead the team.\\" Van Gaal also mentioned the importance of giving opportunities to the younger players in the squad, such as Jesse Lingard, Cameron Borthwick-Jackson, and Andreas Pereira. \\"They are the future of Manchester United, and we need to give them chances to show what they can do,\\" he said. \\"But they also need guidance and support from the senior players, especially in the tough moments.\\" United are currently fourth in the league table, one point behind leaders Manchester City, and have qualified for the knockout stage of the Champions League with two games to spare. However, they have faced criticism for their lack of attacking fluency and for relying on individual moments of brilliance from players like Juan Mata, Anthony Martial, and Memphis Depay. Van Gaal will hope that he can find the right balance between creativity and solidity to unlock the potential of his team, while also keeping the fans and the board happy with the results and the entertainment value. He may have to make some tough decisions along the way, but he seems confident that he can handle them. \\"I am the manager of Manchester United, and I have to do what is best for the club,\\" he said. \\"I know that I have the support of the players, the staff, and the fans, and I am grateful for that.

Pruning is essential for keeping your plants healthy and promoting healthy growth. The first step in pruning your rose bush is to remove any damaged or diseased growth. Look for branches or stems that are discolored or showing signs of mold, and prune them off. By removing these parts, you are helping to prevent the spread of disease and promoting new, healthy growth. Next, take a look at the overall shape of the plant. Rose bushes should be pruned to promote an attractive, open shape that allows for good air circulation. Remove any branches or stems that are crossing or rubbing against each other, and remove any branches that are thin or spindly. When pruning your rose bush, make sure to use sharp, clean tools. Dull tools can damage your plant and make it more susceptible to disease. You should also avoid pruning when the plant is wet, as this can also increase the risk of disease. By taking the time to prune your rose bush in the early spring, you can help ensure that it stays healthy and beautiful throughout the growing season. So, dust off your pruning shears and get to work – your roses will thank you!"},{"prompt":"The 1989 Newcastle earthquake occurred in Newcastle, New South Wales on Thursday, 28 December.

Analysts see the move as a normal part of a game console's life cycle. Nintendo has already announced its next home game console, called the Wii U. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Sony has cut the price of its PlayStation 3 to a base price of 250, a move that analysts see as a normal part of a game console's life cycle. This reduction comes just in time for the holiday season and could help boost Sony's sales. However, the company faces tough competition from Nintendo, which has already announced its next home game console, called the Wii U. The PlayStation 3, which was launched in 2006, has seen several price reductions over the years as newer models and consoles have been released. The base price of 250 is a significant drop from its original price of 600. The system has also undergone various updates and improvements, including faster processing power and increased storage capacity. Analysts say that the price cut is not unexpected, as game consoles typically follow a life cycle that involves price reductions as newer models hit the market. Sony is also facing increased competition from companies like Microsoft and Nintendo, who have released newer models of their own consoles. Nintendo's Wii U, which is set to be released later this year, is a highly anticipated new entry in the gaming console market. It features a tablet-like controller and is expected to offer new and innovative ways to play games. The Wii U's announcement has put pressure on other console makers to innovate and stay competitive. Overall, Sony's price cut is a smart move that could help increase the company's sales in the short term. However, the long-term success of the PlayStation 3 and Sony's other gaming products will depend on their ability to keep up with the rapidly changing gaming industry and compete with the likes of Nintendo and Microsoft."},{"prompt":"Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: After homemade breakfast we visit Startours servicecenter at the hotel and book tours for Wednesday and Thursday Not cheap but an easy way to see some of the island","completion":"After homemade breakfast, we visit Startours service center at the hotel and book tours for Wednesday and Thursday.

This method is particularly useful in warm weather when you may sweat more and need to clean your clothes more often. To use this method, simply wet some paper towels or a piece of cotton cloth with cold water. Make sure the cloth is damp but not soaking wet. Then, lay the shirt flat on a surface and place the damp cloth over the areas that need refreshing. For example, if you have sweat stains on the underarms, place the cloth over those areas. Allow the shirt to air dry completely before wearing it again. This may take a few hours depending on the temperature and humidity of your surroundings. If you're in a hurry, you can use a fan or a hairdryer to speed up the drying process. This method works best for cotton or linen shirts, but can also be used on other materials. It's important to note that this method is not a substitute for washing your clothes regularly. It's simply a quick fix for when you need to freshen up a shirt in between washes. In addition to keeping your clothes clean, it's also important to take care of them to make them last longer. One way to do this is by following the care instructions on the label. For example, some shirts may need to be washed in cold water and hung to dry instead of being put in the dryer. Overall, wetting a shirt with cold water and letting it air dry is a quick and easy way to refresh your clothes.

Whereas the first phase of shōen development in the early Heian period had seen the opening of new lands and the granting of the use of lands to aristocrats and religious institutions, the second phase saw the growth of patrimonial house governments, as in the old clan system. (In fact, the form of the old clan system had remained largely intact within the great old centralized government.) New institutions were now needed in the face of social, economic, and political changes. The Taihō Code lapsed, its institutions relegated to ceremonial functions. Family administrations now became public institutions. As the most powerful family, the Fujiwara governed Japan and determined the general affairs of state, such as succession to the throne. Family and state affairs were thoroughly intermixed, a pattern followed among other families, monasteries, and even the imperial family.

When comparing the two, one key factor to consider is the number of penetrations it takes to burn out each tank. A \\"burn out\\" happens when the tank becomes immobilized and/or destroyed due to a fire. According to historical records, the Tiger tank had much thicker armor than the Sherman tank. As a result, it took significantly more hits to penetrate the Tiger's armor than the Sherman's. However, once the armor was penetrated and a fire started, the Tiger tank tended to burn out more quickly than the Sherman. On average, it took around 2-3 penetrations for a Sherman tank to burn out, while it took 4-5 penetrations for a Tiger tank. This means that while the Tiger tank had superior armor and could withstand more punishment, once it was hit enough times to cause a fire, it was more likely to be destroyed quickly.

Choose a Part 141 school if you have GI Bill benefits. Complete 190 hours of flight training in a schoolapproved aircraft. Take onsite exams to graduate from Part 141 school.","completion":"If you're looking to finish your flight training quickly and efficiently, it's worth considering enrolling in a Part 141 school. These schools are certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and operate under a more structured curriculum, which can help you progress faster in your training. Additionally, if you have GI Bill benefits, enrolling in a Part 141 school can be a smart way to use that funding. To graduate from a Part 141 school, you'll typically need to complete at least 190 hours of flight training in a school-approved aircraft. The exact number of hours required may vary depending on the program and your specific training goals. However, the advantage of a Part 141 school is that the curriculum is designed to help you meet those requirements efficiently. One key difference between a Part 141 school and a Part 61 school (which is not under FAA certification) is that Part 141 schools require on-site testing. This means that instead of taking a checkride with an FAA examiner at the end of your training, you'll undergo periodic exams throughout your training program. While this can feel like additional pressure, it can be helpful in ensuring that you're making adequate progress and mastering the necessary skills along the way. Ultimately, the decision of whether to attend a Part 141 school will depend on your personal goals, learning style, and budget. While Part 141 schools may offer advantages in terms of structure and efficiency, they can also be more expensive than Part 61 schools. Consider speaking with current students and instructors, as well as researching the curriculum and costs of different programs, to make an informed decision about your flight training."},{"prompt":"This is some data: Ariane 5, finalFlight, 20041218.
