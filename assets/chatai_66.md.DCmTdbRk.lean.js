According to ESPN, Winfrey is considering teaming with David Geffen and Larry Ellison for a bid to buy the Los Angeles Clippers from Donald Sterling, who is facing massive pressure to sell the franchise as part of sanctions stemming from his infamous racist rant. Sterling is heard on an audio recording scolding his girlfriend, V. Stiviano, for posting Instagram photos of herself with black acquaintances and for bringing them to Clippers games. Winfrey was outspoken in criticism, saying Sterling’s comments were indicative of a “plantation mentality,” though on Tuesday she had said, “I won’t be buying the Clippers.” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said Tuesday: “I fully expect to get the support I need from the other NBA owners to remove him.” Geffen and software billionaire Ellison were previously tipped as candidates to purchase the Clippers in bidding that may tick toward 800 million. Lakers great Magic Johnson, with financial backer Guggenheim Partners, also is considered a front-runner. The Clippers rank as the 13th most valuable team in the league, according to Forbes, at an estimated 575 million. But the team likely would sell for millions more, on the promise of a rich new cable TV contract. A sports investment banker told The Post’s Josh Kosman the Clippers could sell for as much as as the Nets, valued at 780 million.","completion":"\\"Oprah Winfrey Explores NBA Ownership: A Potential Bid for the Los Angeles Clippers Amid Sterling Controversy\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.

He tells her that he's received a play called \\"Deathtrap\\" from a former student from a playwriting seminar.

Process: - Food enters the small intestine - The small intestine produces hormones - The hormones cause the pancreas to produce enzymes for digestion - The enzymes travel from the pancreas to the small intestine through tubes - The enzymes help the intestines digest the food - The pancreas produces the hormones insuline and glucagon - The hormones control the amount of sugar in the blood. suppose the person drinks more liquid happens, how will it affect the pancreas working SOFTER. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer to this question is:","completion":"indirectly impacting a step of the process. When a person drinks more liquid, specifically water, it could have an indirect effect on the pancreas and its workings. The primary role of the pancreas is to produce digestive enzymes and release hormones like insulin and glucagon to maintain blood sugar levels. When a person drinks more liquid, it does not directly affect the pancreas or its production of enzymes and hormones. However, the indirect effects can come through changes in the composition, dilution, or volume of the fluids within the gastrointestinal tract. Increased fluid consumption can lead to the following indirect consequences for the pancreas: 1. Altered food digestion: Excessive fluid consumption could dilute digestive enzymes and gastric acid in the stomach, which could potentially slow down the breakdown of food. In response to this, the pancreas may need to produce more enzymes to compensate for the diluted enzymes so that digestion proceeds efficiently. Thus, the pancreas will need to work harder to produce more digestive enzymes. 2. Changes in nutrient absorption: Increased fluid intake may temporarily accelerate the passage of food through the small intestine. This could lead to suboptimal absorption of certain nutrients due to the faster transit time. The pancreas may need to increase its production of enzymes to maintain optimal digestion and absorption of nutrients. 3. Impact on blood sugar: Drinking large volumes of fluid can lead to increased urination, which could affect the body's overall glucose metabolism. The pancreas may need to adjust insulin and glucagon production to ensure blood sugar levels remain stable in the face of these fluid imbalances. In conclusion, drinking more liquid has the potential to indirectly impact the pancreas's functions, although it does not directly alter the steps of the pancreatic process. The possible perturbations involve altered food digestion, changes in nutrient absorption, and influence on blood sugar levels, which may require the pancreas to work harder to maintain optimal digestion and blood sugar levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Moore alleges that the United States government evacuated 24 members of the bin Laden family on a secret flight shortly after the attacks, without subjecting them to any form of interrogation.

Sean separates them, and just then Doctor Sanderson (Eduard Franz) enters to tell them about the Indian. He sadly relates to them that the Indian needs a transfusion, but his blood type AB negative is very difficult to match, and the plasma is not doing the job. The Frenchman announces that his blood type is the same as the Indian's, but he will only give it if Kurt asks him. Kurt does, and Sean tells the Frenchman to come out to the compound afterwards, and they'll see about that job.

This drink is perfect for summer parties, barbecues, or simply enjoying on a warm day. Here is the best way to make a Peach Fuzz cocktail: Ingredients: - 2 oz peach schnapps - 1 oz vodka - 3 oz orange juice - Ice - Fresh peach slices (optional) - Orange wedge (optional) - Maraschino cherry (optional) Instructions: 1. Gather all your ingredients: To make the best Peach Fuzz, ensure you have all the necessary ingredients. Choose a high-quality peach schnapps and vodka for optimal taste. It's also advisable to use fresh-squeezed orange juice for the best flavor. 2. Prepare the glass: Start by selecting an appropriate glass for your Peach Fuzz. A highball or Collins glass works well. If desired, you can add a decorative touch to your glass by rimming the edge with sugar. Simply moisten the rim of the glass with a fresh orange wedge and dip it into granulated sugar. 3. Fill the glass with ice: Fill your glass to the top with ice cubes, ensuring that there's enough room for the cocktail mix. 4. Mix the cocktail: In a cocktail shaker or mixing glass, combine the peach schnapps, vodka, and orange juice. If you do not have a cocktail shaker, a mason jar with a lid or even a simple glass with a small plate on top can also work. Fill the shaker with some ice to help chill the mixture while shaking. 5. Shake or stir the cocktail: Cap your shaker or cover the mixing glass, and shake or stir the mixture vigorously for about 15-20 seconds. This helps to mix the ingredients thoroughly while also cooling down the cocktail. 6. Strain the cocktail: Place a strainer over the top of the glass with ice (if you used a shaker, it may have a built-in strainer). Pour the Peach Fuzz mixture into the ice-filled glass, straining to keep out the ice from the shaker. 7. Garnish and serve: For an attractive and tasty garnish, add a fresh peach slice, an orange wedge, and a maraschino cherry to the top of your Peach Fuzz. If you prefer, you can skewer the peach slice and cherry together, balance the garnish on the rim of the glass, or simply drop them into the cocktail. Enjoy your refreshing Peach Fuzz cocktail!

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Sri Aurobindo (Bengali: [Sri Orobindo]) (born Aurobindo Ghose; 15 August 1872 - 5 December 1950) was an Indian philosopher, yogi, guru, poet, and nationalist. He joined the Indian movement for independence from British rule, for a while was one of its influential leaders and then became a spiritual reformer, introducing his visions on human progress and spiritual evolution. Aurobindo studied for the Indian Civil Service at King's College, Cambridge, England. After returning to India he took up various civil service works under the maharaja of the princely state of Baroda and became increasingly involved in nationalist politics and the nascent revolutionary movement in Bengal. In July 1905 then Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon, partitioned Bengal. This sparked an outburst of public anger against the British, leading to civil unrest and a nationalist campaign by groups of revolutionaries, who included Aurobindo. In 1908, Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki attempted to kill Magistrate Kingsford, a judge known for handing down particularly severe sentences against nationalists. However, the bomb thrown at his horse carriage missed its target and instead landed in another carriage and killed two British women, the wife and daughter of barrister Pringle Kennedy. Aurobindo was also arrested on charges of planning and overseeing the attack and imprisoned in solitary confinement in Alipore Jail. The trial of the Alipore Bomb Case lasted for a year, but eventually he was acquitted on May 6, 1909. His defence counsel was Chittaranjan Das. During this period in the Jail, his view of life was radically changed due to spiritual experiences and realizations. Consequently, his aim went far beyond the service and liberation of the country. Aurobindo said he was \\"visited\\" by Vivekananda in the Alipore Jail: \\"It is a fact that I was hearing constantly the voice of Vivekananda speaking to me for a fortnight in the jail in my solitary meditation and felt his presence.\\" In his autobiographical notes, Aurobindo said he felt a vast sense of calmness when he first came back to India. He could not explain this and continued to have various such experiences from time to time. He knew nothing of yoga at that time and started his practise of it without a teacher, except for some rules that he learned from Ganganath, a friend who was a disciple of Brahmananda. In 1907, Barin introduced Aurobindo to Vishnu Bhaskar Lele, a Maharashtrian yogi. Aurobindo was influenced by the guidance he got from the yogi, who had instructed Aurobindo to depend on an inner guide and any kind of external guru or guidance would not be required. In 1910 Aurobindo withdrew himself from all political activities and went into hiding at Chandannagar in the house of Motilal Roy, while the British were trying to prosecute him for sedition on the basis of a signed article titled 'To My Countrymen', published in Karmayogin. As Aurobindo disappeared from view, the warrant was held back and the prosecution postponed. Aurobindo manoeuvred the police into open action and a warrant was issued on 4 April 1910, but the warrant could not be executed because on that date he had reached Pondicherry, then a French colony. The warrant against Aurobindo was withdrawn. What stopped them?","completion":"What stopped them was that Aurobindo went into hiding at Chandannagar in the house of Motilal Roy.

There, she will await her reign once her grandmother, Queen Clarisse (Julie Andrews), steps down as Queen. During Mia's 21st birthday party, she dances with all the eligible bachelors in hope of finding a husband. She becomes attracted to a handsome gentleman named Nicholas (Chris Pine). During the course of the night, Mia's tiara falls off and is caught by Parliament member Viscount Mabrey (John Rhys-Davies) who secretly plans to steal Mia's crown. While the Parliament is in-session the next morning, Mia stumbles upon a hidden room that allows her to secretly listen in. Viscount Mabrey reveals his nephew, Lord Devereaux, is another heir to the Genovian throne. Despite Queen Clarisse's objection, the only way Mia can assume her duties as Queen is if she marries within the month. Clarisse invites Lord Devereaux to stay at the palace, while Mia is shocked to discover Lord Devereaux is Nicholas. Mia's best friend Lilly Moscovitz (Heather Matarazzo) surprises her by visiting. Together, they pick through potential husbands. Mia eventually chooses Andrew Jacoby (Callum Blue), Duke of Kenilworth and days later they are engaged. Mabrey plans to have Nicholas woo Mia and dissolve the engagement. For a ceremony, Mia is to ride sidesaddle but does not know how. Queen Clarisse provides an ancestral wooden leg decoy to make it look like she's riding sidesaddle.

At a garden party,... Answer:","completion":"In \\"The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement,\\" Nicholas Devereaux, played by Chris Pine, tricks Mia Thermopolis, played by Anne Hathaway, into spending more time with him under the manipulative guidance of his uncle, Viscount Mabrey. Viscount Mabrey, who wants to get Lord Devereaux on the throne of Genovia, plans to have Nicholas woo Mia and dissolve her engagement with Andrew Jacoby, Duke of Kenilworth. Nicholas manipulates situations where he appears as a compassionate and charming person, making it hard for Mia to resist his charm. One example is when Mia suffers humiliation during a riding ceremony after being spooked by a rubber snake planted by Mabrey. Nicholas finds Mia in the stable and tries to comfort her, showing his seemingly sensitive side, in an attempt to get closer to her. As the movie progresses, Mia begins falling for Nicholas, jeopardizing her chances of becoming Queen if she were to break her engagement with Andrew Jacoby. However, it is essential to note that as Nicholas gets to know Mia, he starts to have genuine feelings for her and regrets his initial intentions of deceiving her. In conclusion, Nicholas tricks Mia by presenting himself as a sensitive and charming man to win her affection, all in an effort to weaken her engagement and potential claim to the throne. His actions are a critical part of the film's plot, contributing to the internal and external conflicts Mia has to overcome throughout the story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence: \\"Susan did so the baker.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"A linguist would likely not rate the sentence \\"Susan did so the baker\\" as acceptable linguistically, as it lacks clarity and proper grammatical structure. In order for a sentence to be considered linguistically acceptable, it must adhere to the rules of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Let's break down the sentence to understand its various shortcomings. 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the rules governing the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language. In the sentence \\"Susan did so the baker,\\" the syntax seems off. The sentence appears to be missing a verb to provide a proper connection between \\"Susan\\" and \\"the baker.\\" For example, a syntactically correct sentence may read as, \\"Susan helped the baker.\\" 2. Semantics: Semantics is the study of meaning in language. It deals with the relationship between words, phrases, and the meaning they convey. In the sentence under consideration, it is unclear what \\"did so\\" exactly means. It would be more semantically clear if the sentence explained what Susan did. A semantically refined sentence might be, \\"Susan baked bread with the baker.\\" 3. Pragmatics: Pragmatics is concerned with understanding the intended meaning of a sentence beyond its literal meaning. It deals with how context influences comprehension. In the case of \\"Susan did so the baker,\\" the intended meaning is not evident, making it difficult to extract any context or purpose from the statement. A pragmatic representation of the sentence could be, \\"Susan assisted the baker in preparing the pastries for the event.\\" By addressing the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic issues of the original sentence, we can create a more linguistically acceptable sentence, such as, \\"Susan assisted the baker in preparing the pastries for the event.\\" This version provides context, meaning, and proper structure that a linguist would consider acceptable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this scenario, the premise is: \\"Three males are walking across a field.\\" The hypothesis is: \\"Three males are walking across a green field.\\" To arrive at a detailed conclusion, let's analyze the premise and the hypothesis carefully. Premise: \\"Three males are walking across a field.\\" This statement simply tells us that there are three males walking across a field, with no additional information about the field's characteristics. The field could be of any color, size, or condition. Hypothesis: \\"Three males are walking across a green field.\\" Here, the statement includes a description of the field's color - it is green. Now let's evaluate the choices: (1). Yes - This means that the hypothesis must be true if the premise is true. The issue with this choice is that the premise doesn't provide us any information related to the color of the field. So, we cannot conclude that the field is green based on the premise alone. Thus, this option is incorrect. (2). It is not possible to tell - This choice implies that we cannot determine with certainty whether the hypothesis is true or not based on the premise. As the premise offers no information about the field's color, we can't confidently establish that the hypothesis is true. This option suggests a level of uncertainty, which is accurate in this case. (3). No - This selection implies that the hypothesis is false if the premise is true. However, the premise doesn't contradict the hypothesis. Neither does it confirm it. There is a possibility that the field is green, but the premise doesn't provide enough information to make such a conclusion. So, this option is also incorrect. Based on our analysis, the most appropriate choice is (2) \\"It is not possible to tell.\\" We cannot conclude if the hypothesis is true based on the premise because there isn't enough information about the field's color in the premise to support or refute the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the name of the waterway that connects the North Sea to the Atlantic Ocean via Loch Ness?","completion":"The name of the waterway that connects the North Sea to the Atlantic Ocean via Loch Ness is the Caledonian Canal. This impressive canal stretches approximately 60 miles (97 kilometers) across northern Scotland, facilitating travel and transportation through a series of interconnected natural lakes and man-made channels between the two bodies of water. Designed by the renowned Scottish engineer Thomas Telford, the construction of the Caledonian Canal began in 1803 and was completed in 1822. The canal was primarily built as a response to the Napoleonic Wars, as it provided a safer and more efficient alternative route for shipping to bypass the hazardous waters along the northern coast of Scotland that were prone to attacks by pirates, storms, and hidden rocks. The Caledonian Canal is comprised of 29 locks, four aqueducts, and 10 bridges to manage the different water levels and to overcome elevation changes along the route. The iconic Loch Ness, famous for its mythical Loch Ness monster or \\"Nessie,\\" is one of the four natural freshwater lochs linked by the canal. The others are Loch Dochfour, Loch Oich, and Loch Lochy. From the eastern entrance at Inverness, the canal initially follows the course of the River Ness before reaching Loch Dochfour. It then continues through the famous Loch Ness, entering Loch Oich, and finally reaches Loch Lochy. At the southern end of Loch Lochy, the canal takes to man-made channels again and eventually emerges into the sea at Corpach, near Fort William, on the west coast of Scotland. In addition to its functionality in marine transportation and commerce, the Caledonian Canal has gained popularity as a key destination for leisure and recreation. It offers visitors and locals alike a wide range of activities, including boating, sailing, canoeing, fishing, and walking along the scenic towpaths. Furthermore, the canal and the Great Glen Way it traverses, both play a vital role in the local tourism industry, benefiting the economy and communities of the Highlands. In summary, the Caledonian Canal is a remarkable waterway connecting the North Sea to the Atlantic Ocean via Loch Ness. Its combination of historical engineering, natural beauty, and recreational opportunities continues to make it a significant location in Scotland's cultural and economic landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Whitehall's disquiet at the failures of the RAF led to the replacement of Dowding (who was already due for retirement) with Sholto Douglas on 25 November. Douglas set about introducing more squadrons and dispersing the few GL sets to create a carpet effect in the southern counties. Still, in February 1941, there remained only seven squadrons with 87 pilots, under half the required strength. The GL carpet was supported by six GCI sets controlling radar-equipped night-fighters. By the height of the Blitz, they were becoming more successful. The number of contacts and combats rose in 1941, from 44 and two in 48 sorties in January 1941, to 204 and 74 in May (643 sorties). But even in May, 67% of the sorties were visual cat's-eye missions. Curiously, while 43% of the contacts in May 1941 were by visual sightings, they accounted for 61% of the combats. Yet when compared with Luftwaffe daylight operations, there was a sharp decline in German losses to 1%. If a vigilant bomber crew could spot the fighter first, they had a decent chance at evading it. Answer:","completion":"The special aspect about the night fighters was that they were radar-equipped, which allowed them to be more successful during the Blitz. With the support of the GL carpet and GCI sets, these night-fighters saw an increase in the number of contacts and combats throughout 1941, leading to a higher success rate when compared to their previous performance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let say you have come up with 10 such keywords.","completion":"Once you have brainstormed with industry experts and come up with 10 potential keywords for your website, there are several steps you can follow to refine your keyword list, analyze their potential, and strategically integrate them into your overall content plan. 1. Competitor Analysis: Research the websites of your top competitors and identify the keywords they are targeting. This will give you an idea of the most popular and relevant keywords in your market. You can use tools like SEMrush, Ahrefs, or Moz to analyze the keywords used by your competitors. 2. Google Keyword Planner: Use Google Keyword Planner or other keyword research tools to gauge the search volume and competition for each keyword. This will help you identify popular keywords with high search volume and relatively low competition so you can create targeted content in these areas. 3.

This will help you prioritize your content creation and ensure a well-rounded content strategy. By covering a range of related topics, you will increase your chances of ranking well for multiple keywords. 5. Assess Keyword Intent: When analyzing and refining your keywords list, you should also assess the user intent behind each keyword. Are searchers looking for information, a solution to a problem, or a specific product? This understanding will help in crafting content that addresses the specific needs and intents of your target audience. 6. Content Creation: Use your keyword list to create high-quality content that goes beyond mere keyword-stuffing. Integrate your keywords naturally and strategically into your blog posts, articles, product descriptions, web pages, and other forms of content. Incorporate both short-form and long-form content to cater to different user preferences. 7. On-Page SEO: Optimize your website to include proper on-page SEO elements. This includes incorporating your focused keywords in title tags, meta descriptions, URL slugs, and header tags. Additionally, implement schema markup to better communicate with search engines and enhance your search result appearance. 8. Track Performance: Regularly analyze the performance of your website and the content using tools like Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and any other preferred analytics software. Keep track of organic search traffic, rankings for your target keywords, and other vital metrics. 9. Iteration: Based on your analytics and the performance of your content, make adjustments to your keyword targets and content strategy as needed. This ongoing process of keyword optimization and content refinement will ensure that you stay ahead of the competition. 10. Adopt New Keyword Trends: Finally, stay informed on emerging trends and popular topics in your industry. By keeping track of new developments, you can identify new keywords and niches early on, allowing you to create content that meets the growing demand. Conclusion: Finding the right keywords for your website is a crucial aspect of your SEO and content strategy. Use the methods mentioned above to generate an effective keyword list, analyze their potential, and incorporate them into high-quality, targeted content that will rank well in search engines and attract your target audience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The world itself is becoming much smaller by using modern traffic and modern communication means . Life today is much easier than it was hundreds of years ago, but it has brought new problems. One of the biggest is pollution. To pollute means to make things dirty. Pollution comes in many ways. We see it, smell it, drink it and even hear it. Man has been polluting the earth. The more people, the more pollution. Many years ago, the problem was not so serious because there were not so many people. When the land was used up or the river was dirty in a place, men moved to another place. But this is no longer true. Man is now slowly polluting the whole world. Air pollution is still the most serious. It's bad to all living things in the world, but it is not only one kind of pollution. Water pollution kills fish and pollutes drinking water. Noise pollution makes us become angry more easily. Many countries are making rules to fight against pollution. They stop the people from burning coal in houses and factories in the city, and from blowing dirty smoke into the air. The pollution of SO2 is now the most dangerous problem of air pollution. It is mostly caused by heavy traffic. It is certain that if there are fewer people driving, there will be less air pollution. The earth is our home. We must take care of it. That means keeping the land, water and air clean. And we must try to control the growth of population at the same time. Question: Our world is becoming much smaller . Options: A: because the earth is being polluted day and night B: because science is developing C: because of the rise in population D: because the earth is blown away by the wind every year The answer is:","completion":"B: because science is developing. The statement \\"Our world is becoming much smaller\\" refers to the advancements in technology and communication that have made it easier for people to connect with each other and access resources and information around the globe. This process is a direct result of the development of science and technology, not because of pollution, population growth, or the earth being blown away by the wind. As mentioned in the article, modern traffic and communication means have contributed significantly to making the world feel smaller. Technological advancements like the internet, smartphones, and faster modes of transportation have all played a role in breaking down barriers and bridging distances between people and nations. While pollution and the rise in population are mentioned as problems in the article, they do not directly contribute to the world becoming smaller. Pollution is identified as a critical issue that needs to be addressed, but it is a separate concern from the shrinking of the world due to technological advancements. Similarly, the rise in population can exacerbate pollution and resource scarcity, but it does not directly influence the world becoming smaller. Finally, the option \\"D: because the earth is blown away by the wind every year\\" is not relevant to the context of the article and does not have any logical connection to the statement. In conclusion, the correct answer is option B: because science is developing, as it is the development of science and technology that has made the world feel smaller by facilitating faster and more efficient communication and transportation systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president.

Dogen finds a murdered prospector, whose young daughter Dhyana saw him killed by Baal, Jared Syn's half-cyborg son. Baal sprayed the man with a green liquid that caused a nightmare dream-state, in which Syn appeared and executed him with a crystal. Dogen convinces Dhyana to help him find Syn. Dhyana takes Dogen to Zax, who identifies the crystal as a lifeforce storage device. Dhyana tells them about the ancient Cyclopians who once used such devices and says the only power against it is a magic mask located in their lost city. Zax affirms this and directs Dogen to find a prospector named Rhodes in the nearby mining town of Zhor. Dogen and Dhyana are blocked by vehicles driven by nomads commanded by Baal, who sprays Dogen with the green liquid, paralyzing him. Dhyana drives them off and cares for Dogen, who in the dream world finds Syn and Baal looming over him. Syn fails to pull Dogen away from Dhyana: their will is too strong.

Write down the given equation: -1443 * b = -1440 * b + 54 2. The primary goal is to isolate the variable b. To do that, we want to eliminate the term -1440 * b from the right side of the equation. We will add 1440 * b to both sides: (-1443 * b) + (1440 * b) = (-1440 * b) + (1440 * b) + 54 By adding these terms, we simplify the equation: -3 * b = 54 3. Now, we need to solve the equation for b. Since b is being multiplied by -3, we will divide both sides of the equation by -3: (-3 * b) / -3 = 54 / -3 By dividing the terms, we get: b = -18 So, the solution to the given linear equation is: b = -18"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor. He then called my OB and told him he thought I’d had a stroke. My OB immediately expressed his doubt but my husband was advised to call an ambulance to get me to the ER. I never really experienced pain from the stroke. Question: What is the name of the narrator's husband?

This transfers can be pivotal for a player's career and can significantly impact their success in the years to come. Such is the case for former Rangers midfielder Kyle Hutton, who recently inked a deal with Dumbarton after being released by St Mirren. A Promising Start at Rangers Born in Glasgow on February 6, 1991, Kyle Hutton had an illustrious start to his professional football career with Rangers F.C. His success as a promising young midfielder didn't go unnoticed, leading to his inclusion in the first team in 2010. During his time at Rangers, Hutton played under notable managers, such as Walter Smith and Ally McCoist, who were instrumental in guiding his development. The years spent learning from some of the best minds in the sport allowed him to cultivate his skills and understand the finer tactics of the game. Loan Spells and Move to St Mirren Despite his strong start and promising potential, Hutton eventually found himself loaned to various clubs in search of regular playing time. He had temporary stints with Partick Thistle, Dunfermline Athletic, Airdrie United, and Queen of the South, where he continued to gain valuable experience on the pitch. After leaving Rangers in 2015, Hutton joined St Mirren, seeking to establish himself as a dominant presence in the team's midfield. However, his time with the Buddies did not go quite as planned. Although he made numerous appearances, he never managed to lock down a regular starting position. Joining Dumbarton and Future Prospects After being released by St Mirren, Kyle Hutton was on the lookout for a new opportunity to reignite his footballing career. He found what he was looking for with Scottish League One side Dumbarton F.C., led by manager Jim Duffy. Signing Hutton is a significant coup for Dumbarton, who will benefit from the vast experience and leadership qualities he brings to midfield. Moreover, it showcases the club's ambitions to move up the league table and become a formidable force in Scottish football. For Hutton, it marks a fresh start, a chance to put past setbacks behind him and demonstrate his true worth. The seasoned midfielder will surely relish the opportunity to make a substantial impact in a team that clearly values and believes in his abilities. Conclusion In football, finding the right fit can make all the difference in a player's career trajectory. For Kyle Hutton, the journey from Rangers to Dumbarton has been a testament to his resilience, determination, and unwavering passion for the sport he loves. As he embarks on this new chapter with Dumbarton, fans of both the player and the club will be keenly watching to see if this move proves to be the catalyst for Hutton's resurgence as a force to be reckoned with in Scottish football. For now, one thing is certain - the stage is set for Hutton to prove that the best years of his career are still ahead of him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below: After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a...

This move showcases Hibernian's commitment to retain Allan despite continued interest from one of the country's top clubs. 1. Background of Rangers' Interest in Scott Allan Rangers have been keeping a close eye on Scott Allan due to his impressive performances for Hibernian since joining the club in 2014. Allan's excellent midfield skills and consistency in gameplay have caught the attention of Rangers, and they have been attempting to bring the player over to their team for quite some time now. 2. Previous Bids from Rangers This is not the first time Rangers have placed a bid to acquire Scott Allan. They have previously made two unsuccessful bids, and Hibernian has remained steadfast in their decision to not let go of their valued midfielder. Rangers' management, however, has not been deterred and has continued to express interest in signing Allan. 3. Hibernian's Firm Stance on Keeping Allan Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs has demonstrated unwavering support for Allan, repeatedly stating that the club has no intention of selling him. Stubbs believes that Allan is an integral part of the club's success and losing him would be a significant blow to the team. Consequently, Stubbs is ensuring that Allan remains with Hibernian and continues to contribute to their journey in Scottish football. 4. Implications of the Rejected Bid The rejection of this third bid from Rangers only heightens the tension between the two clubs, as Rangers may be feeling growing frustration with Hibernian's refusal to negotiate. This could potentially lead to an even more substantial bid from Rangers in an attempt to secure Allan's transfer. However, it also demonstrates Hibernian's determination to maintain their player despite the lucrative offers they are receiving. 5. Future Possibilities for Scott Allan With three bids rejected, it remains uncertain how Rangers' pursuit of Scott Allan will unfold in the future. If Rangers continue to intensify their efforts, it could put pressure on Hibernian to reconsider their stance on keeping Allan. However, the player's future will ultimately be determined by the decisions of both clubs and the outcome of ongoing negotiations. Conclusion In summary, Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs has confirmed that the club has rejected a third bid from Rangers for their star midfielder Scott Allan. This move highlights the club's unwavering commitment to retaining Allan, despite the strong interest from one of the top Scottish football clubs. As Rangers remain persistent in their pursuit, the future of both clubs and the player remains uncertain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Title: Lotion Pump Dispenser Review: I can not use this product as its screw-on cap is too large for my intended use. Until I find a larger bottle it will remain in storage. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The customer appears to be dissatisfied with the Lotion Pump Dispenser. Although the customer does not explicitly state their overall satisfaction level, we can deduce their discontent from the context and issues raised in the review. First, the issue with the screw-on cap being too large indicates that the product did not meet the customer's specific needs for their intended use. This misfit between their expectations and the dispensers' design leads to functional dissatisfaction, which renders the product virtually useless for the customer. Second, the reviewer mentioning that the dispenser will remain in storage until they find a larger bottle implies that they have not been able to use the product yet. Additionally, the need to purchase another item (a larger bottle) to make the dispenser functional indicates inconvenience and added expenses for the customer. In most cases, this could lead to a negative experience and dissatisfaction with the product. Lastly, the fact that the customer decided to leave a review highlighting the issue with the screw-on cap size suggests that they were disappointed enough to share their experience with others. This public expression of disappointment and unmet expectations can be interpreted as an indication of dissatisfaction. In conclusion, based on the context and details provided in the review, it is reasonable to infer that the customer's experience with the Lotion Pump Dispenser was a dissatisfying one, primarily due to the mismatch between the dispensers' design and the customers' intended use.

Deveraux finds his leader Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren), who has gone insane, with a string of severed ears and holding a young boy and girl hostage. Devereaux, who is near the end of his tour of duty, tries to reason with Scott, who shoots the boy and orders Devereaux to shoot the girl to prove his loyalty. Deveraux refuses and tries to save the girl, but Scott kills her with a grenade. The two soldiers shoot each other to death.

It took 14 years to rebuild, mostly using original stones. More than a dozen of Banja Luka's mosques were destroyed during the war. The Bosnian Serb authorities say the re-opening demonstrates their commitment to ethnic tolerance. The mosque was blown up 23 years ago, at the height of the Yugoslav civil war when Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks), Croats and other non-Serbs were expelled from their homes in a tactic known as ethnic cleansing. Known as the Ferhadija, the mosque was rebuilt after architects managed to recover about two-thirds of the original stone and use plans drawn up when an earthquake damaged it in the 1960s. Saturday's re-opening took place amid tight security, with about 1,000 police officers patrolling the streets as buses arrived with Muslims from across the country. Traffic was barred from the city centre and alcohol consumption was banned. Turkey financed part of the rebuilding and outgoing Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu re-opened the mosque in front of a congregation of about 10,000 people. He said the new building sent a message of peace. \\"Bosnia-Herzegovina, with its Muslims, Catholics, Orthodox and Jews, is one body, one heart. If there is any attempt to split it up, it means that this one heart would be split,\\" he said in an apparent reference to secessionist threats by Bosnian Serbs. Bosnia's Grand Mufti, Hussein Kavazovic, called the re-opening \\"a joyous day for all\\". Banja Luka's Orthodox and Catholic bishops added their congratulations - while the president of Bosnia's Jewish community said the co-operation showed how people should live in the region. The re-opening was also welcomed by the UN and the EU. At least 100,000 people in total died during fighting in the the Bosnian war. The conflict lasted nearly four years before a US-brokered peace deal brought it to an end in 1995. Banja Luka is the capital of the Republika Srpska - one of two entities comprising Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is estimated that now only about 10% of Banja Luka's pre-war Muslim and Croat population remain in the city.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Hemophilia is a group of diseases in which blood does not clot normally. Factors in blood are involved in clotting. When you bleed, your body begins a coagulation cascade of reactions, involving special proteins known as coagulation factors, to stop that bleeding. When one or more of these clotting factors are missing, there is a higher chance of having dificulties stoping the bleeding. Hemophiliacs lacking the normal Factor VIII are said to have Hemophilia A (or Factor VIII deficiency), the most common form. Hemophilia is a genetic disease, passed down through family. It is linked to the X-chromosome, so it mostly affects males. F8 is the gene for the Factor VIII protein. Mutations in the F8 gene lead to the production of an abnormal version of coagulation factor VIII, or reduce the amount of the protein. The altered or missing protein cannot participate effectively in the blood clotting process. Q: What is the term for diseases in which blood does not clot normally? A: Answer:","completion":"The term for diseases in which blood does not clot normally is Hemophilia. Hemophilia is a group of hereditary genetic disorders that impair the body's ability to create blood clots, a process which is needed to stop bleeding. This is caused by the deficiency of specific coagulation factors in the blood - special proteins that play a crucial role in blood clotting. These factors work in a specific sequence, known as the coagulation cascade, to form a clot and stop bleeding. Interestingly, when one or more of these clotting factors are deficient or missing, the coagulation cascade cannot function properly, causing prolonged or excessive bleeding. There can be different types of hemophilia, defined by the specific coagulation factor that is missing. For instance, Hemophilia A, the most common form of the disease, is caused by a deficiency in Factor VIII. This deficiency arises due to mutations in the F8 gene - the gene responsible for the production of Factor VIII protein. These mutations either lead to the production of an abnormal version of coagulation factor VIII or diminish the amount of the protein. As a result, the affected person's blood has difficulty clotting effectively, which can lead to prolonged bleeding after injury. Hemophilia is a genetic condition usually inherited from parents to their children and is linked to the X-chromosome. Because of this, it predominantly affects males. Nonetheless, it's crucial to note that the severity of hemophilia can vary from mild to severe, depending on the level of the clotting factors in the blood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While Ferdie is hiding a hunter and two of his hunting dogs come and try to kill little Ferdie and Ferdie is running as fast as possible until he is out of breath and starts panting. While the hunter is firing gunshots towards Ferdie Casper notices they are trying to kill him and flies in the hunter's direction and pleads that the hunter leaves Ferdie alone.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What statue was nickmamed Old Flo? , can you please find it? In December 2005, the two ton Reclining Figure (1969–70) – insured for £3 million – was lifted by crane from the grounds of the Henry Moore Foundation on to a lorry and has not been recovered. Two men were jailed for a year in 2012 for stealing a sculpture called Sundial (1965) and the bronze plinth of another work, also from the foundation's estate. In October 2013 Standing Figure (1950), one of four Moore pieces in Glenkiln Sculpture Park, estimated to be worth £3 million, was stolen. In 2012, the council of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets announced its plans to sell another version of Draped Seated Woman 1957–58, a 1.6-tonne bronze sculpture. Moore, a well-known socialist, had sold the sculpture at a fraction of its market value to the former London County Council on the understanding that it would be displayed in a public space and might enrich the lives of those living in a socially deprived area. Nicknamed Old Flo, it was installed on the Stifford council estate in 1962 but was vandalised and moved to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1997. Tower Hamlets Council later had considered moving Draped Seated Woman to private land in Canary Wharf but instead chose to \\"explore options\\" for a sale. In response to the announcement an open letter was published in The Guardian, signed by Mary Moore, the artist's daughter, by Sir Nicholas Serota, Director of the Tate Gallery, by filmmaker Danny Boyle, and by artists including Jeremy Deller. The letter said that the sale \\"goes against the spirit of Henry Moore's original sale\\" of the work. The answer is:","completion":"The statue nicknamed Old Flo is \\"Draped Seated Woman 1957–58,\\" a 1.6-tonne bronze sculpture by Henry Moore."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They detained one suspect , and seven additional suspects were detained in another operation targeting an AQI senior leader . Tips from local residents helped Coalition forces envelop a village southwest of Mosul that is reportedly a hideout for AQI facilitators and smugglers coming in from Syria . Fifteen suspects were detained . Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: Why were Coalition forces targeting the man ?","completion":"In the given passage, Coalition forces in Mosul targeted a man because they believed he was responsible for overseeing financial operations for Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) in the Ninawa province. Targeting this individual was likely a part of a broader strategy to dismantle AQI's financial and operational networks, which would weaken the organization's capacity to carry out acts of terror and undermine its influence in the region. There were multiple operations mentioned in the passage, with some resulting in the detention of eight suspects, including the one believed to be involved in AQI's financial operations. In another operation, seven additional suspects were detained, targeting an AQI senior leader. This further emphasizes the Coalition forces' efforts to disrupt AQI's leadership and organizational structure. Furthermore, the passage indicates that local residents played a crucial role in aiding Coalition forces. Tips from residents helped the forces envelop a village southwest of Mosul, which was reportedly a hideout for AQI facilitators and smugglers coming in from Syria. As a result, fifteen suspects were detained in this village. This exemplifies how cooperation between local communities and Coalition forces contributes to the fight against AQI and its network in the region. In conclusion, Coalition forces targeted the man in Mosul because they believed he played a significant role in AQI's financial operations in Ninawa province. By disrupting the financial capabilities and targeting the leadership of AQI, Coalition forces aim to weaken the organization's capacity to carry out acts of terror and diminish its presence and influence in the region. Additionally, the passage highlights the importance of cooperation between local residents and Coalition forces, as the information they provide can dramatically impact the effectiveness of anti-terrorism efforts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:This article: Brougham Castle (pronounced ) is a medieval building about 2 miles (3.2 km) south-east of Penrith, Cumbria, England. The castle was founded by Robert I de Vieuxpont in the early 13th century. The site, near the confluence of the rivers, Eamont and Lowther, had been chosen by the Romans for a Roman fort called Brocavum. The castle is scheduled as an Ancient Monument, along with the fort, as \\"Brougham Roman fort and Brougham Castle\\".In its earliest form, the castle consisted of a stone keep, with an enclosure protected by an earthen bank and a wooden palisade. When the castle was built, Robert de Vieuxpont was one of the only lords in the region who were loyal to King John. The Vieuxponts were a powerful land-owning family in North West England, who also owned the castles of Appleby and Brough. In 1264, Robert de Vieuxpont's grandson, also named Robert, was declared a traitor, and his property was confiscated by Henry III. Brougham Castle and the other estates were eventually returned to the Vieuxpont family, and stayed in their possession, until 1269, when the estates passed to the Clifford family through marriage. With the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence, in 1296, Brougham became an important military base for Robert Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford. He began refortifying the castle: the wooden outer defences were replaced with stronger, more impressive stone walls, and a large stone gatehouse was added. The importance of Brougham and Robert Clifford was such that, in 1300, he hosted King Edward I of England at the castle. Robert's son, Roger Clifford, was executed as a traitor, in 1322, and the family estates passed into the possession of King Edward II of England, although they were returned once his son Edward III became king. The region was often at risk from the Scots, and in 1388, the castle was captured and sacked. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who hosted King Edward I at a castle?, what is it ? A:","completion":"The full name of the person who hosted King Edward I at Brougham Castle is Robert Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"Upon reading this review, it would decrease the chances of me buying the product. Here are my step-by-step thoughts and justification: 1. The review title states \\"Disappointing, I expected more.\\" This immediately sets a negative tone and highlights that the reviewer felt let down by the book. 2. The reviewer mentions a personal connection with the subject matter (post-war Germany), implying they have a strong knowledge and understanding of the topic. This could indicate that their expectations were higher than someone without that connection. 3. The reviewer criticizes the book for having a superficial and empty portrayal of the protagonist's inner struggle. This suggests that the book may not offer a deep or nuanced exploration of the characters and their experiences. 4. The fact that the reviewer considered the possibility of translation errors shows that they were trying to understand the reasons for their disappointment and did not immediately dismiss the book. 5. The reviewer's parents, who also have direct experience with the subject matter, shared the same negative opinion of the book. This further confirms the sense that the book may not provide the depth or perspective that the reviewer was hoping for. 6. Despite the book being a quick read, the fact that the reviewer felt nothing by the end of it indicates a lack of emotional impact and overall dissatisfaction with the book. Based on these points, the review would make me less likely to purchase the product, as it highlights a lack of depth, emotional impact, and authenticity in portraying the subject matter."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, the Headland Development Trust which ran it collapsed in 2012. Hartlepool Borough Council said it is trying to find groups to take on the facility and has spent about £50,000 mothballing the building. Mark Patton, the local authority's assistant director for education, learning and skills, said it would be \\"a crying shame\\" if the building was not used. \\"At the time there was clearly a view from central government that things were in place to make it happen,\\" Mr Patton said. \\"There is a clear potential here now and we have to work collectively to do something about that.\\" The facility was funded by the Department for Education, which said \\"all necessary checks were taken by the Big Lottery Fund\\" which administrated the £4.5m on behalf of the government. The scheme was intended to provide space for young people and help tackle anti-social behaviour by enabling them to re-engage them with their communities. Children's services committee chairman Alan Clark said the facility \\"will have to be self-sustainable because the council doesn't have the resources to fund this building\\".

Context: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump... Question: When did Comey write his book?

She did not like her ugly colour. She was attracted by the colour of the lake near her home. It was as blue as the sky after a storm. Bluebird wanted to be the colour of that beautiful lake very much. Flapping her wings one morning, Bluebird flew from her tree to the blue lake. Then she bathed in the water three times. After each bath, she sang, \\"Blue water. Still water. I went in. I am blue.\\" Bluebird repeated this every morning. On the third day, she came out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers. Now Coyote was a trickster --and hungry too. He stayed behind Bluebird's tree for a long time every day and watched her go to the lake. He pretended to be interested in everything she did. He wanted Bluebird for lunch, but he was afraid of the blue water. On the third morning, Coyote saw Bluebird come out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers. Impressed, he sat next to Bluebird's tree and waited for her. When she returned, he asked, \\"How did you get blue feathers? I want to be blue like the mountains too.\\" Bluebird didn't believe Coyote, but she taught him how to bathe three times each morning and how to sing her song. Coyote did what she said, and after three days of bathing in the lake, his white fur turned deep blue. Convinced that blue fur was even more beautiful than blue feathers, Coyote forgot all about being hungry. He ran as fast as he could to the top of the hill. Standing on his back legs, he raised his front legs off the ground and howled. But Coyote slipped and rolled down the hill. He couldn't stop himself, and the dust and dirt covered his new blue fur.

Meanwhile, alcoholic journalist Peter Fallow, anxious for a story to make good with his editor, comes upon the hit-and-run case as a rallying point for the black community calling upon Jewish district attorney Abe Weiss, who is the Bronx District Attorney seeking re-election. According to Judge Leonard White, almost all of DA Weiss' prosecutions end up with black and Puerto Rican defendants going to prison and Weiss is seeking a white defendant for purposes of convincing the minority-majority community that he is worth re-electing. Weiss recognizes the press coverage inherent in prosecuting the callow Sherman, who has been discovered as the owner of the car, and therefore presumed to be the hit-and-run driver, in order to cultivate the image as an avenger for the minorities and be propelled to the mayorship of New York City. As Sherman is brought to his knees, New York City fragments into different factions who use the case to suit their own cynical purposes. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person Weiss wants to prosecute?, what is it ?

Lem tries to ask Neera on a date, but her hippie friend, Glar, keeps interrupting with his protest songs. A mysterious spacecraft goes into orbit around Planet 51 and sends out a signal. On Planet 51, under a secret Army installation called Base 9 (their version of Area 51), there is a basement filled with Earth artifacts including robotic satellites launched by the United States and the Soviet Union. The spacecraft's signal activates Rover, a wheeled A.I. probe. Rover escapes, following a program to locate the newly arrived astronaut. The Planetary Army becomes suspicious after Rover's escape and begins to investigate. The spacecraft touches down in Lem's backyard; NASA astronaut Charles \\"Chuck\\" T. Baker emerges. As Chuck plants the United States flag, he steps on a \\"rubber ducky\\" someone left on the ground. Everyone stares, and Chuck tries to get back into his module.

Have a bottle on the kitchen counter and a large weight book on the table. b). In this article, the most common places you could find a lava lamp are under the bathtub, under a sink (if there's one), or even in your backyard. Cut one half of the soda to size in the bottle. c). The larger you keep the glass, the more grainy the lip of the bottle. Measure out about 1/2 a gallon (1.9 liters) of soda. d). This method is safe for kids to follow on their own, and much faster and easier than making a permanent lava lamp. Young kids can ask an adult to do the pouring for them. Answer:","completion":"d). This method is safe for kids to follow on their own, and much faster and easier than making a permanent lava lamp. Young kids can ask an adult to do the pouring for them. Explanation: Option (a) is incorrect because it only involves filling the bottle with water, which is not the main ingredient to create a lava lamp effect. Mentioning a large weight book on the table is also unrelated to the task. Option (b) is incorrect because it talks about the possible locations of a lava lamp, which is not relevant to the next step in making one. Also, cutting one half of the soda to size in the bottle doesn't make sense in this context. Option (c) is incorrect because using soda as an ingredient doesn't create a lava lamp effect.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the first name of the descendant of Robert Campbell? ? The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

Jackass is an American reality series, originally shown on MTV from 2000 to 2002, featuring people performing various dangerous, crude, self-injuring stunts and pranks. The show served as a launchpad for the television and acting careers of Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, and Steve-O, who previously had only minor acting roles. The show later sparked several spin-offs including Wildboyz, Viva La Bam, Homewrecker, Bam's Unholy Union, and Dr. Steve-O as well as three feature films distributed by MTV corporate sibling Paramount Pictures. Jackass sparked considerable amounts of controversy, as it was seen as indecent and encouraging of dangerous behavior. The show developed from Big Brother Magazine, a skateboarding-related humor magazine that Jeff Tremaine, Dave Carnie, Rick Kosick and Chris Pontius all worked for, and featured regular contributions from Johnny Knoxville and Dave England, among others. The concept of Jackass dates back to 1998, when failing-actor-turned-writer Johnny Knoxville thought of the idea of testing different self-defense devices on himself as the basis for an article. He pitched the idea to a couple of magazines and was turned down until meeting with Jeff Tremaine of Big Brother. Tremaine hired him as a journalist and convinced Johnny to videotape this idea and other stunts for stories. The footage, which involved Knoxville being tasered, maced, and shot while wearing a bulletproof vest, appeared in the second Big Brother skateboarding movie: Number 2. Future Jackass castmember Wee-Man made an appearance in the videos as well. During this time, Bam Margera released a movie titled Landspeed:CKY, consisting of himself and his friends, which he dubbed the \\"CKY Crew\\", in West Chester, Pennsylvania, performing various skits and stunts. The Crew included the colorful cast of Ryan Dunn, Brandon Dicamillo, and Raab Himself, as well as Margera's family April, Phil, Don Vito, and Jess Margera. Tremaine saw the tapes and drafted Margera and his crew into what would become the cast of Jackass. Later, the Jackass crew would recruit Steve-O in a Florida flea market where he worked as a clown. To round out the cast, England brought in his friend Ehren McGhehey, a fellow Oregon resident and extreme stunt participant. Preston Lacy would be the last of what is now considered the main cast to join, auditioning midway through the show's run by eating four bananas with the peels on. Tremaine drafted his friend, director Spike Jonze, to get involved with the show, and together, he, Jonze, and Knoxville served as executive producers. The show idea was pitched, and the cast was initially given an offer by Saturday Night Live to perform the stunts weekly for the show, though the offer was turned down. A bidding war occurred between Comedy Central and MTV, which MTV eventually won. It was then that Jackass was born. What year did the shows start?","completion":"The Jackass show started in the year 2000."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Choices: + no + yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Yes, the answer to these two questions would essentially be the same, as both are asking for the definition or explanation of what muscle is. I will provide a detailed explanation of muscle to address both questions. A muscle is a soft tissue in the body of humans and animals that has the functionality to contract and produce force and movement. Muscles are made up of muscle fibers, which are long, multinucleated cells. These fibers are bundled together by connective tissue, forming a muscle. The human body has more than 600 muscles, which make up roughly 40% of the body weight. Muscles can be classified into three main types based on their structure and function: 1. Skeletal muscle: This type of muscle is attached to bones by tendons, which are strong connective tissues. Skeletal muscles are responsible for voluntary movement and the maintenance of posture and skeletal stability. These muscles are striated, meaning their cells have a repetitive pattern of light and dark bands, which is associated with the presence of actin and myosin filaments. Skeletal muscles are also considered multinucleated, meaning that they have multiple nuclei in a single cell. 2. Smooth muscle: This type of muscle is present in the walls of internal organs and structures like blood vessels, stomach, intestines, and the reproductive system. They are responsible for involuntary movements and functions such as controlling the diameter of blood vessels, the movement of food through the digestive system, and contracting the uterus during childbirth. Smooth muscle cells are spindle-shaped and have a single nucleus in each cell. They are non-striated, as they do not have the distinct banding pattern seen in skeletal muscles. 3. Cardiac muscle: This specialized muscle is found in the walls of the heart and is responsible for the heart's contractile function, which pumps blood throughout the body. Similar to skeletal muscles, cardiac muscles are striated and multinucleated, but they have their intrinsic rhythm and pace, which means that the contractions occur without requiring neural stimulation. They are also interconnected through structures called intercalated disks, which support synchronized contractions and rapid transmission of electrical impulses throughout the heart muscle. In summary, a muscle is a soft tissue found in the human body and animals responsible for generating movement and force by contracting its cells. There are three main types of muscles, namely skeletal muscles, smooth muscles, and cardiac muscles, each with its unique structure and function."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

About 1,000 people yesterday descended on Nakoso beach, about 40miles south of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, where three reactors melted down after the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The opening was celebrated with beach volleyball games and hula dancers from a nearby spa. A family plays on Nakoso Beach in Iwaki in Japan's Fukushima state. The beach is the first to be opened to the public since the nearby nuclear power station meltdown following the earthquake and tsunami of March 2011. Playtime: About 1,000 people yesterday descended on Nakoso beach, about 40miles south of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant. Iwaki city official Joji Kimura said negligible radiation was detected in water at the beach. Airborne radiation was measured at 0.08 microsieverts an hour, far below dangerous levels. Swimming had been banned at all beaches in the state since the disaster last March. The opening took place on the same. day that the Japanese government came under fire over its handling of. public hearings on nuclear energy policy. The criticism threatens to dent already sagging support for the ruling party ahead of an election many expect to be this year. The latest furore follows Monday's massive rally in Tokyo against nuclear power in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. Local officials and analysts say the. issue is now so contentious that it could trump taxes as the focus of. lower house elections, which must be held by September 2013 but could. come sooner. News that power company employees. were among the few chosen to speak at hearings on changes to energy. policy after Fukushima, the world's worst atomic disaster in 25 years, have been greeted with widespread scepticism. On duty: Three local women working as tour guides enter the water in front of a gaggle of photographers and cameramen. Mass demonstrations: Anti-nuclear energy protesters march through Tokyo on Monday. Fun times: An anti-nuclear protester dressed as a clown is watched by police officers. Koichi Nakano, a professor at Sophia University, said: 'This gives the impression that they haven't learned anything.' It echoes a scandal just one year. ago, when Kyushu Electric Power sought to sway public opinion at a. hearing on restarting reactors in southern Japan. In a sign of the growing discontent,. more than 100,000 anti-nuclear protesters marched in Tokyo on Monday,. adding to pressure on Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, already struggling. as his Democratic Party unravels over plans to hike the sales tax to. curb public debt. Mr Nakano said: 'The anti-nuclear people are calling for the Democrats to be voted out.' The rally was the biggest since Noda. said last month that Japan needs to restart idled nuclear reactors to. protect jobs and the economy. Damning: The nuclear accident at Fukushima last year was a 'man-made disaster' and not completely because of the tsunami, a report said earlier this month. Reactor meltdown: The damning indictment was delivered by the Japanese parliamentary panel. Disaster: Smoke is pictured ascending from the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant's Unit 3 in Okumamachi in Fukushima Prefecture on March 14 last year. The government is considering three. options for its medium-term energy portfolio - reduce nuclear power's. role to zero as soon as possible, aim at a 15 per cent share by 2030,. and seek a 20 to 25 per cent share by the same date. The new energy mix, to be decided in. August, will replace a scrapped 2010 programme that had sought to raise. nuclear power's share to more than half of electricity needs by 2030. from about 30 per cent before the March 2011 disaster. The Fukushima disaster forced some. 150,000 people to flee their homes, many never to return. Some committed. suicide after seeing their homes and livelihoods destroyed. Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said the government would be looking at how to improve the hearings. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"In Japan, they opened the first beach for people to swim at since a big problem happened at a nuclear plant last year.

On their quest to go to the next location of the traveling circus, \\"Precipice Lake\\", they come upon a billabong, the oasis of the Outback. They witness from their cliff location that a pack of dingos (and a thylacine) are chasing a bilby but rescued by a kangaroo, a wombat army, and a vine-swinging female koala talented at throwing a boomerang. Boris, a vulture, reveals that Bog intends on taking over the Billabong. When their rescue goes wrong and the dingos threaten to take over, the rock Johnny is on breaks free and he slides down the cliff and ends up rolling on top of a boulder that chases the dingos away. Hamish introduces the now-famous white koala as \\"Koala Kid\\". Miranda, the boomerang expert koala, is not impressed but Johnny watches her from a tree as she practices.

In his theory, James proposed that the perception of what he called an \\"exciting fact\\" directly led to a physiological response, known as \\"emotion.\\" To account for different types of emotional experiences, James proposed that stimuli trigger activity in the autonomic nervous system, which in turn produces an emotional experience in the brain. The Danish psychologist Carl Lange also proposed a similar theory at around the same time, and therefore this theory became known as the James–Lange theory. As James wrote, \\"the perception of bodily changes, as they occur, is the emotion.\\" James further claims that \\"we feel sad because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble, and neither we cry, strike, nor tremble because we are sorry, angry, or fearful, as the case may be.\\" Who developed a theory similar to that of James?","completion":"Carl Lange developed a theory similar to that of William James."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - A red giant burns mass - This mass creates high core temperatures - The mass decreases - The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center - The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers - The layers break away - Only the inner core remains - This inner core is known as a white dwarf. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less leaves fall on the ground happens, how will it affect More mass is burned by the red giant. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis question involves a scenario where fewer leaves fall on the ground, and you would like to know if this has any impact, be it direct or indirect, on the red giant's process of burning mass, eventually leading to the formation of a white dwarf. In order to give a thorough and long response to this question, let's analyze both aspects of the question: the process of a red giant burning mass and transitioning to a white dwarf, and the influence of fewer leaves falling on the ground on this process. First, let's break down the process of a star evolving from a red giant to a white dwarf. 1. A red giant burns mass: Stars like our sun expand into red giants during the latter stages of their lives. This occurs when the hydrogen fuel at the core of the star is depleted, causing the core to contract under the influence of gravity. As the core contracts, the temperature and pressure within it increase, which, in turn, causes the outer layers of the star to expand and heat up. 2. High core temperatures: The increased core temperatures trigger helium fusion, converting helium into carbon and oxygen. This helium fusion process is what primarily fuels the red giant's luminous energy output. 3. Mass decreases: Over time, the mass of the red giant is gradually lost due to the radiation of energy and stellar wind activity. This loss of mass causes a decrease in the gravitational force acting on the outer layers of the star. 4. Carbon and oxygen fusion in the star's center ceases: At a certain point, the core temperature and pressure are no longer sufficient to support the fusion of heavier elements like carbon and oxygen, leading to the end of fusion reactions in the core. 5. Layers break away: With the cessation of fusion reactions, the outer layers of the red giant are no longer held together by the gravitational force of the core. Consequently, these layers drift away to form a planetary nebula, leaving behind the core. 6. Formation of a white dwarf: The exposed core of the star, now devoid of the outer layers, is referred to as a white dwarf. This remnant is supported by electron degeneracy pressure, preventing further contraction under the force of gravity. White dwarfs no longer undergo fusion reactions and gradually cool over time. Now let's examine the second part of the question, which is about the effect of fewer leaves falling on the ground. It is important to note that events occurring on Earth, such as leaves falling, do not affect the processes that take place within a star, including the transition of a red giant into a white dwarf. The process of a red giant burning mass and gradually turning into a white dwarf is determined entirely by factors intrinsic to the star, such as its mass, composition, and the physical processes occurring within its interior. As a consequence, any perturbation associated with fewer leaves falling on the ground would not impact the process described in the given context. In other words, the supposed perturbation has no direct or indirect effects on the process of a star evolving from a red giant to a white dwarf. These two scenarios are independent, with the evolution of a star being dictated by astrophysical factors and the leaf-fall perturbation pertaining to events within our planet's ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who is credited with very few works? is inside the article: The attribution of the panel reflects the progression and trends of 19th and 20th-century scholarship on Early Netherlandish art. It is now thought to have been completed c. 1438–40, but there are still arguments for dates as early as 1424–29. As with the pages ascribed to Hand G in the Turin-Milan Hours manuscript, the panel was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert van Eyck in the 1875 Gemäldegalerie catalogue, and by a 1911 claim by art historian Georges Hulin de Loo. This is no longer considered credible and Hubert, today, is credited with very few works. By 1912 the painting had been definitively attributed to Jan in the museum catalogue.Attempts to date it have undergone similar shifts of opinion. In the 19th century the panel was believed to be an early work by Jan completed as early as c. 1410, although this view changed as scholarship progressed. In the early 20th century, Ludwig von Baldass placed it around 1424–29, then for a long period it was seen as originating from the early 1430s. Erwin Panofsky provided the first detailed treatise on the work and placed it around 1432–34. However, following research from Meyer Schapiro, he revised his opinion to the late 1430s in the 1953 edition of his Early Netherlandish Painting. A 1970s comparative study of van Eyck's 1437 Saint Barbara concluded that Madonna in the Church was completed after c. 1437. In the 1990s, Otto Pächt judged the work as probably a late van Eyck, given the similar treatment of an interior in the 1434 Arnolfini Portrait. In the early 21st century, Jeffrey Chipps Smith and John Oliver Hand placed it between 1426 and 1428, claiming it as perhaps the earliest extant signed work confirmed as by Jan., can you guess it ?

SEOUL — North Korea’s sudden threat to pull out of the upcoming summit with the U.S. raises new doubts of whether a denuclearization deal is possible. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to meet with U.S President Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12 to work out an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. But on Wednesday North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Kwan released a statement through the state-run KCNA news agency that criticized “unbridled remarks” made specifically by the U.S. president’s National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding that Pyongyang completely decommission its entire nuclear arsenal, along with its ballistic missile program and chemical weapons stockpile, before receiving any compensation or concessions. He expressed “indignation” at the U.S uncompromising position and said North Korea might pull out of the Trump-Kim summit, unless the Trump administration acts with “sincerity” to improve relations through dialogue. “If the United States is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the North Korea-U.S. summit,” the statement said. The vice foreign minister also said it was “absolutely absurd” that Bolton would compare Libya’s experience dismantling its relatively rudimentary nuclear program as a model for dealing with the North’s more advanced and expansive capabilities. He also denounced the Trump administration for “miscalculating the magnanimity” of Kim Jong Un’s decision to suspend further nuclear and missile tests, and his willingness to engage in nuclear talks, as “signs of weakness,” that were the result of what the U.S. administration has dubbed its “maximum pressure” campaign that led international efforts to impose punishing sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade. The vice minister’s remarks came shortly after the North abruptly canceled... According to the above context, answer the following question. What did the vice minister probably think about the US wanting North Korea to disband the nuclear arsenal? Available options: A). he was not caring either way. B). He probably completely disagreed. C). not enough information. D). he partly agreed. Answer:","completion":"B). He probably completely disagreed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: How many casualties were there? Movie title: The Towering Inferno Movie plot: Architect Doug Roberts returns to San Francisco for the dedication of the Glass Tower, which he designed for owner James Duncan. At 138 stories (1,800Â ft/550Â m), it is the world's tallest building. Shortly after his arrival, an electrical short starts an undetected fire on the 81st floor. While Roberts accuses the building's electrical engineer, Roger Simmons of cutting corners, Simmons insists the building is up to standards. During the dedication ceremony, public relations chief Dan Bigelow is ordered to turn on the tower's exterior lights to impress the guests and dignitaries. The lighting overloads the electrical system and Roberts orders it shut off. Smoke is seen on the 81st floor and the San Francisco Fire Department is summoned. Roberts and engineer Will Giddings go to the 81st floor but fail to prevent a security guard opening a door, leading to a fire flash which burns Giddings (and who is later disclosed to have died). Roberts reports the fire to a dismissive Duncan, who refuses to order an evacuation. Ill-equipped firefighters arrive to tackle the blaze, which soon spreads out of control. SFFD Chief Michael O'Halloran forces Duncan to evacuate the guests in the Promenade Room on the 135th floor, directing them to express elevators. A guest, Lisolette Mueller, who is being wooed by con man Harlee Claiborne, rushes to the 87th floor to check on a young family. Simmons admits to Duncan that he cut corners to stay under budget. Duncan, aided by Senator Parker and Mayor Ramsey, directs the elevator evacuation from the Promenade Room until the fire renders the express elevators unsafe. Not heeding Duncan's directions, one last group takes an elevator to the ground, but are killed when it stops on the fire's floor. The fire also traps Bigelow and his secretary/mistress Lorrie in his 65th floor office, killing them. Security Chief Harry Jernigan and Roberts rescue Mueller and the family from 87.

Information: - The American Civil War was a civil war in the United States fought from 1861 to 1865. The Union faced secessionists in eleven Southern states grouped together as the Confederate States of America. The Union won the war, which remains the bloodiest in U.S. history. - The German Confederation was an association of 39 German states in Central Europe, created by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 to coordinate the economies of separate German-speaking countries and to replace the former Holy Roman Empire. Most historians have judged the Confederation to have been weak and ineffective, as well as an obstacle to the creation of a German nation-state. It collapsed due to the rivalry between Prussia and Austria, warfare, the 1848 revolution, and the inability of the multiple members to compromise. - An army (from Latin \\"arma\\" \\"arms, weapons\\" via Old French \\"armée\\", \\"armed\\" (feminine)) or ground force is a fighting force that fights primarily on land. In the broadest sense, it is the land-based military branch, service branch or armed service of a nation or state. It may also include other branches of the military such as the air force via means of aviation corps. Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a field army. They differ from army reserves who are activated only during such times as war or natural disasters. - A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology, is a war between organized groups within the same state or country, or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly united state. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC. - Italian unification, or the Risorgimento (meaning \\"resurgence\\" or \\"revival\\"), was the political and social movement that consolidated different states of the Italian peninsula into the single state of the Kingdom of Italy in the 19th century. The process began in 1815 with the Congress of Vienna and was completed in 1871 when Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy. The memory of the Risorgimento is central to both Italian politics and Italian historiography, for this short period (181560) is one of the most contested and controversial in modern Italian history. Italian nationalism was based among intellectuals and political activists, often operating from exile. - Dominions were semi-independent polities under the British Crown, constituting the British Empire, beginning with Canadian Confederation in 1867. They included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, and the Irish Free State, and then from the late 1940s also India, Pakistan, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The Balfour Declaration of 1926 recognised the Dominions as \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire\\", and the 1931 Statute of Westminster granted them full legislative independence. - Cavalry (from French \\"cavalerie\\", cf. \\"cheval\\" 'horse') or horsemen were soldiers or warriors who fought mounted on horseback. Cavalry were historically the most mobile of the combat arms. An individual soldier in the cavalry is known by a number of designations such as cavalryman, horseman, dragoon or trooper. The designation of cavalry was not usually given to any military forces that used other animals, such as camels, mules or elephants. Infantry who moved on horseback, but dismounted to fight on foot, were known in the 17th and early 18th centuries as dragoons, a class of mounted infantry which later evolved into cavalry proper while retaining their historic title. - The Austro-Prussian War or Seven Weeks' War (also known as the Unification War, PrussianGerman War, German Civil War, War of 1866, Brothers War, or Fraternal War, and in Germany as the German War) was a war fought in 1866 between the German Confederation under the leadership of the Austrian Empire and its German allies on one side and the Kingdom of Prussia with its German allies on the other, that resulted in Prussian dominance over the German states. This conflict also paralleled the Third Independence War of Italian unification. - The Royal Prussian Army served as the army of the Kingdom of Prussia. It became vital to the development of Brandenburg-Prussia as a European power. - The Kingdom of Prussia was a German kingdom that constituted the state of Prussia between 1701 and 1918 and included parts of present-day Germany, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Denmark, Belgium and the Czech Republic. It was the driving force behind the unification of Germany in 1871 and was the leading state of the German Empire until its dissolution in 1918. Although it took its name from the region called Prussia, it was based in the Margraviate of Brandenburg, where its capital was Berlin. - English America, and later British America, were the English, and later British, territories in North America (including Bermuda), Central America, the Caribbean, and Guyana from 1607 to 1783. Formally, the British colonies in North America were known as \\"British America and the British West Indies\\" until 1776, when the Thirteen British Colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard declared their independence and formed the United States of America. After that, British North America (or, simply but not inclusively, Canada) was used to describe the remainder of Britain's continental North American possessions. The term \\"British North America\\" was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report. - A nation (from Latin: \\"natio\\", \\"people, tribe, kin, genus, class, flock\\") is a large group or collective of people with common characteristics attributed to them including language, traditions, \\"mores\\" (customs), \\"habitus\\" (habits), and ethnicity. By comparison, a nation is more impersonal, abstract, and overtly political than an ethnic group. It is a cultural-political community that has become conscious of its autonomy, unity, and particular interests. - The Austrian Empire (modern spelling \\"\\") was an empire in Central Europe created out of the realms of the Habsburgs by proclamation in 1804. It was a multinational empire and one of Europe's great powers. Geographically it was the second largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire (621,538 square kilometres [239,977 sq mi]). It was also the third most populous after Russia and France, as well as the largest and strongest country in the German Confederation. Proclaimed in response to the First French Empire, it overlapped with the Holy Roman Empire until the latter's dissolution in 1806. The \\"Ausgleich\\" of 1867 elevated Hungary's status. It became a separate entity from the Empire entirely, joining with it in the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - Prussia was a historic state originating out of the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and centred on the region of Prussia. For centuries, the House of ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army. Prussia, with its capital in and from 1701 in Berlin, shaped the history of Germany. In 1871, German states united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership. In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 191819. The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republicthe Free State of Prussia, a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933. From 1933, Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup, when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its ' laws in pursuit of a unitary state. With the end of the Nazi regime, the division of Germany into allied-occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the line, which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union, the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto in 1945. Prussia existed \\"\\" until its formal liquidation by the Allied Control Council Enactment No. 46 of 25 February 1947. - Secession (derived from the Latin term \\"secessio\\") is the withdrawal of a group from a larger entity, especially a political entity (a country), but also any organization, union or military alliance.

The personal circumstances we are experiencing have caused us to stress and let go of our anger on each other. We both know that this needs to change and we have been working to resolve this. We were having an especially rough morning and broke out into an argument. I can't even remember what we were arguing about because it wasn't over a real issue. Before we were able to resolve the argument, we had to go to work. We work for the same company but usually never see each other because we are in different departments. However, there was a required meeting everyone was required to be in that day. I could feel and see her giving me dagger eyes from across the room so I made a little heart with my hands to alleviate some of the tension. My fiancé made another heart but broke it in half which I thought was hilarious. In response, I texted her (yes during the meeting) \\"Thank you for splitting your heart and giving me half of it. I love you\\". She responded back with \\"you're an ass for not taking me seriously\\" but I assumed that she was responding to my joke when she did this?

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If there is less contact with the virus, fewer cells will be initially infected. This could result in a slower spread of the virus within the body, potentially giving the immune system more time to mount a response. The perturbation of reduced viral contact could directly affect the initial stage of the infection process, where the virus binds to target cells and enters them. Indirectly, this perturbation may also impact the overall efficiency of the viral replication process and the ability of the virus to spread within the host. The reduced initial contact could ultimately affect the overall damage to cells, as fewer cells would be infected or produce viral copies. Additionally, the immune system might be more effective in recognizing and neutralizing the virus before it can infect large numbers of cells. In summary, the perturbation of less contact with the virus would potentially have both direct and indirect effects on the process of virus infection and replication. It could lead to fewer cells being infected and damaged, as well as an improved immune response due to a slower rate of viral spread."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Had this kind of data mining been in place 13 years ago, the 9/11 attacks might never have happened, he said. Highlights of his argument, picked up by Mediaite: “Before 9/11, there was an individual by the name of Khalid al-Mihdhar who came to be one of the principle hijackers. He was being tracked by the intelligence agencies in the Far East. They lost track of him.” “At the same time, the intelligence agencies had identified an al-Qaeda safe house in Yemen. They understood that that al-Qaeda safe house had a telephone number, but they could not know who was calling into that particular safe house.” Authorities learned after 9/11 that it was Mihdhar calling from San Diego. \\"If we had the telephone number in Yemen, we would have matched it up to that number in San Diego ... and identified Mihdhar.\\" Democrat John Conyers, who warned in his opening statement \\"that we are on the verge of becoming a surveillance state,\\" wasn't wowed by the 9/11 argument, reports the Guardian. \\"I am not persuaded that makes it OK to collect every phone call.\\" Expand this summary.","completion":"FBI chief Robert Mueller said that if the government had phone and internet surveillance a long time ago, maybe there wouldn't have been any 9/11 attacks.

Watching the post parade at this weekend's Kentucky Derby will surely fill some of our heads with dreams of horse ownership. How did the julep-sipping folks acquire their prized horses? How much is buying a racehorse going to set you back? Are they sound investments? These are all tricky questions, but let's take a look at a few stories of horse sales that turned out to be winning lottery tickets...and a few that were more dud than stud. Mr. Prospector becomes a daddy again and again. In 1971, Mr. Prospector was a yearling that fetched 200,000 at auction. When he took to the track, he was good but not great; he won seven of 14 starts but only brought home 112,170 during his career. Still, in 1980 he sold for 20 million. What happened? It turns out \\"Mr. P.\\" was a stud in every sense of the word. While his racing career might not have been the most distinguished, it's tough to argue with his results as a stud. He sired a winner of each of the Triple Crown races, and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren have been similarly speedy. His sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons have combined to win over 30 Triple Crown races and pull in around 100 million in earnings. Mr. P.'s Derby-winning son Fusaichi Pegasus fetched 60 million in 2000, and 18 years earlier, another son -- Belmont winner Conquistador Cielo -- sold for 36.4 million. Mental Floss: Did famous horses get their names? John Henry drives steel, wins cash. When John Henry, a yearling foaled in 1975, came up for bids at the Keeneland January Mixed Sale, he didn't generate much buzz. He had fairly mundane bloodlines, he wasn't particularly big, and he had a nasty temper -- he got his name from a tendency of smashing steel feed buckets. John Calloway bought the unheralded gelding for a modest 1,100 investment and hoped he could make a little cash back on the horse. How did it work out? By the time John Henry retired from racing, he was the top-earning gelding in history with over 6.5 million in career earnings. He won 25 graded stakes races and was racehorse of the decade for the 1980s. Not a shabby return on a 1,100 investment. The Green Monkey makes a monkey out of bidders. Unless you're a huge fan of the band America, you might not envision shelling out eight figures for a horse with no name. That's exactly what happened in a January 2006 auction at Calder Race Course, though. When the auctioneers brought a colt who was only known as \\"number 153\\" to the auction block, a fierce bidding war broke out. Buyers weren't afraid to open their wallets for a colt that was described as \\"perfect,\\" and when the hammer dropped the horse went for a record 16 million. The winning bidders quickly christened the colt The Green Monkey, and excitement to see how the horse would do in races began to build. After all, the colt had run an eighth of a mile in a blazing 9.8 seconds in pre-auction workouts, so anything was possible once he started racing. The buyers thought they were getting a Triple Crown threat. Instead they got the thoroughbred version of Ryan Leaf. The Green Monkey could never translate his workout speed into actual races, and in his career, he only managed one third-place finish in a measly three starts. In 2008, his owners retired him from racing to stand at stud. If his progeny enjoy the success that eluded the Green Monkey, he might make some of his substantial purchase price back. It will be tough, though; right now he only pulls in 5,000 as a stud fee. Mental Floss: 7 things to know about the Kentucky Derby. ...But he's in good company. The Green Monkey shouldn't feel too bad. The horses he took the \\"most expensive colt\\" record from didn't fare much better. Seattle Dancer set the yearling price record in 1985 when he went for a cool 13.1 million before going on to win 150,000 in his five career starts. Snaafi Dancer's sale in 1983 was the worst investment this side of Pets.com stock; the first yearling to break the 10 million price mark never raced -- and was infertile. Cigar comes up empty. Even casual sports fans may remember Cigar, the bay stallion who racked up an incredible 16 straight wins from 1994 to 1996. If Cigar had picked up just 187 more during his career, he would have become the first horse ever to break 10 million in race earnings. When the former Breeders' Cup Classic Champ came up for sale in 1998, there were more than a few breeders who wanted to get their hands on him. Cigar sold for 25 million and promptly went out to stud to recoup some of that cash. That's when breeders discovered a problem: the horse that some analysts called \\"the second-best racehorse ever\\" was infertile. Cigar's new owners got a record 25 million payout on an insurance policy that covered infertility, and the champion stallion is spending the autumn of his years at the Kentucky Horse Park's Hall of Champions. Mental Floss: 7 strange stories of lost cell phones. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"The Kentucky Derby has many people dreaming about owning their own racehorses. The cost of buying a racehorse can vary, with some examples from history including Mr. Prospector, who was bought for 200,000 and eventually sold for 20 million after a successful racing and breeding career. Another example is John Henry, who was bought for only 1,100 and went on to earn over 6.5 million in racing. However, sometimes the investment doesn't pay off, like in the case of The Green Monkey, who was bought for a record 16 million but was unsuccessful in racing. There are no guarantees in investments, and racehorses are no exception. Some people may find great success with their racehorses, while others may not have the same luck. It's important to remember that buying a racehorse is a risky investment and it's not always a guarantee that the horse will pay off in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Believing the technology is dangerous, Pym vows to hide it as long as he lives. In the present day, Pym's estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne, and former protégé, Darren Cross, have forced him out of his company, Pym Technologies. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the Yellowjacket, which horrifies Pym. Upon his release from prison, well-meaning thief Scott Lang moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. Lang visits his daughter Cassie unannounced and is chastised by his former wife Maggie and her police-detective fiancé, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold down a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect. Terrified by the experience, he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested on the way out. Pym, the homeowner, visits Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him break out.

I think we are fine with their setoff language (part A only) because the NDP always has the option to permit setoff to other agreements between the parties as to amounts payable by the Payee to the Payer (where the Payer owes money under the ISDA to the Payee). So here's my recommendation: (1) Call your friend Andre and hear what he has to say. He has some kind of suggestion about Part (B) and limiting the NDP's payment to the DP to be based upon satisfaction that \\"nondisputed\\" amounts having been paid by the DP. Will he also raise the \\"other agreements\\" issue here? Not a clue. (2) If Cargill leaves part A in tact and we agree to change part B, I'M FINE. (I'm fine without part B, actually) (3) The potential problem is that Cargill and ENA view part A differently, right off the bat. I think Cargill is wrong because they don't read part A as applying to \\"other agreements between the parties\\".

This sounds obvious, but the first step before you can give away a vehicle is to make sure that you are the legal owner. To do that, you must have the title.","completion":"After verifying ownership of the vehicle, there are several steps you should follow to ensure a smooth and legally compliant gifting process. These steps include: 1. Determine if there are any liens on the vehicle: Ensure that there are no outstanding liens or loans against the vehicle. If there are, you must clear them before gifting the car to another person. This information can be found on the title or by contacting any lienholders listed on the document. 2. Obtain necessary forms and paperwork: Depending on the state or country where both the giver and the receiver live, you will need to gather important forms and documents. Some common documents include a bill of sale, title transfer form, a gift affidavit or statement, and any applicable tax forms for reporting the gift. 3. Prepare the bill of sale: Although the vehicle is a gift, it is still essential to draft a bill of sale. This document serves as a legal record of the transaction, specifying the date and parties involved. It also helps establish that the vehicle was, in fact, a gift and not sold for any monetary consideration. 4. Transfer the title: To transfer the title of the vehicle, the giver must complete the appropriate section on the backside of the title, including the vehicle's odometer reading, their signature, and the recipient's information. In some cases, you may need to submit a separate title transfer form along with the signed title to the local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or equivalent government agency. 5. Complete the gift statement or affidavit: Depending on your local requirements, you might need to submit a gift statement or affidavit that indicates the vehicle was given as a gift. Such documents usually require the signatures of both the giver and receiver, as well as the vehicle's identifying information (e.g., vehicle identification number or VIN, make, model, etc.). 6. Report the gifted vehicle, if required: In some regions, you must report the gifted vehicle to the local tax authority or other government offices. Consult your area's regulations to determine if you need to do so and comply accordingly. 7. Obtain insurance for the recipient: Before the recipient can legally drive the gifted vehicle, they must acquire sufficient auto insurance coverage. The recipient should notify their insurance company of the new vehicle to ensure they have suitable coverage before operating the car. 8. Register the vehicle: The recipient must register the gifted vehicle at the local DMV or an equivalent government agency. If the giver or recipient live in different states or countries, follow the regulations in both jurisdictions to fulfill any required vehicle inspections or emissions tests. 9. Pay applicable fees or taxes: Depending on local rules, there may be fees or taxes associated with registering a gifted vehicle. The recipient should research these costs and prepare to cover them when registering the car. 10. Deliver the gifted vehicle: Once all paperwork, fees, and registration have been completed, the giver can now hand over the keys and the vehicle gift. The recipient should remember to store and maintain all paperwork related to the gifted vehicle for future reference and in case of any disputes. In conclusion, gifting a vehicle involves preparing and submitting the necessary documents, fees, and taxes associated with transferring the title, registering the car, and obtaining insurance coverage. It is important to consider the local regulations in both the giver's and recipient's jurisdictions to ensure a smooth and legally compliant process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort – that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews.

If I tell you that Animals may compete for territory, water, food, or partners, and ask you the question \\"animals can compete for territory, water, food, or what?\\", is the correct answer \\"environment\\"?","completion":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"animals can compete for territory, water, food, or what?\\" would be \\"partners,\\" as mentioned in the given statement. It implies that animals may engage in competition for gaining access to essential resources such as territory, water, and food, as well as finding suitable mating partners. To elaborate further on each of these resources: 1. Territory: Animals often compete for territory to establish dominance, protect their home range, and provide a safe environment for themselves and their offspring. Adequate territory provides them access to essential resources such as food, water, and shelter. Establishing and defending a territory can also help reduce conflict with neighboring individuals or groups of the same species. 2. Water: Water is a vital resource for all living organisms, and animals may compete for access to water sources such as lakes, rivers, and watering holes. In habitats where water is scarce or seasonal, competition for water can be particularly intense. Water not only quenches an animal's thirst but also plays a critical role in various physiological processes like temperature regulation, digestion, and nutrient absorption. 3. Food: Access to food is essential for an animal's survival and reproduction. Food resources could include plant material, prey species, or decomposing organic matter. By competing for food, animals can secure the necessary energy and nutrients to maintain their health, grow, and reproduce. In many cases, individuals or groups with better access to food have a higher chance of successfully raising offspring and passing on their genes to future generations. 4. Partners: Reproduction is a fundamental aspect of an animal's life, and finding suitable mating partners is crucial for the long-term survival of a species. Animals may compete for mates to ensure their genes are passed on to the next generation. This competition can manifest in various ways, such as displays of physical prowess, demonstrations of resource accumulation, or courtship rituals. Mating success often depends on an individual's ability to outcompete rivals and attract the attention of potential partners. To sum up, the correct answer to the question \\"animals can compete for territory, water, food, or what?\\" is \\"partners.\\" The term \\"environment\\" doesn't accurately capture the specific elements highlighted in the statement, which are territory, water, food, and partners. The environment, in broader terms, encompasses all these aspects and more, but it is not the direct answer to the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact.

Summarize this article: \\"Bradford are a shining light to all lower division teams,\\" Perryman, a two-time FA Cup winner during a 17-year Tottenham career, told BBC Sport. \\"To beat three Premier League sides, whatever teams they picked, gives everyone hope.\\" Exeter's director of football was in charge of the Bees when they faced the might of Liverpool the last time they reached the FA Cup quarter-finals in 1989. Brentford have reached the FA Cup quarter-finals four times, the last occasion being in the 1988-89 season when they were beaten 4-0 by reigning Division One champions Liverpool at Anfield. Martin Allen guided the Bees to FA Cup fifth-round appearances in 2005 and 2006 where they lost to Premier League sides Southampton, after a replay, and Charlton Athletic. This is the first season in six since that Brentford have got beyond the third round - and in all but one of the other seasons, they have not even got that far. Chelsea and Brentford have only met once before in the FA Cup, with the Blues winning the tie in 1950 by a 1-0 scoreline. The Bees beat a Premier League team on their last appearance in the fourth round, overcoming bottom of the table Sunderland 2-1 in 2006. Charlton 3-1 Brentford A Reds side with John Barnes, Peter Beardsley, Steve McMahon, Ronnie Whelan and Ray Houghton at the peak of their powers ultimately cruised to a 4-0 win at Anfield, But Perryman's Bees, then, like now, a side in the third tier of English football, had their opportunities early on and he was proud of the way his team handled themselves and the occasion. \\"I think Richard Cadette had two good chances,\\" said Perryman, who skippered Spurs to their FA Cup wins over Manchester City and QPR in 1981 and 1982. \\"Of course I am a bit biased, and maybe a quarter or a half-chance becomes three quarters of a chance - but we could easily have gone ahead. \\"I always thought the first goal was so vital. Liverpool were a great side but I felt they could be vulnerable early on and could be slow starters. \\"We had the first chance early on but didn't take it, and although we didn't live with them in the end, we didn't go there to defend and gave it a really good go.\\" Giving it a good go is exactly what Perryman feels Uwe Rosler's League One promotion hopefuls need to do against an under-pressure Chelsea side who have struggled for consistency since making a blistering start to the season. And while, like that day at Anfield, the odds are stacked heavily in the top-flight side's favour for the first competitive west London derby between the two sides since 1950, Perryman says any FA Cup underdog must be full of belief. \\"Don't tell me you can't get a slip in the box and a lucky break. It's possible,\\" said the Spurs legend, who also won two Uefa Cups and the League Cup twice during his time at White Hart Lane. \\"The longer the smaller team are level, the better their chance - and it only takes a defensive error or a great delivery from a set-piece. \\"There will be a great atmosphere at Griffin Park and that probably lifts the smaller team more than the big team because Chelsea will be used to it. \\"There are no mugs in the lower divisions now. They are all fit, they will have a spring in their step and they can cause an upset.\\" Perryman was Bees boss for three and-a-half years from 1987, and he believes that cup run - which involved seven games just to reach the quarter-finals - did wonders for their belief. Brentford are not an up-and-under, blowing-the-bugle type team. But actually that will probably suit Chelsea more A squad featuring Andy Sinton, Tony Parks, Neil Smillie, Keith Jones, Gary Blissett and Cadette had to win two replays and beat three higher-division clubs in Manchester City (who won promotion to the old Division One that season), Blackburn Rovers and Walsall to set up their dream tie at Anfield. It did come at a cost though. \\"Unfortunately, playing all those games hampered our league progress a bit that season,\\" Perryman said. \\"We were in a good position for promotion and it didn't quite happen. You get involved in so many games there has to be a focus taken away. \\"But I think it was the prelude to getting promoted under Phil Holder in 1992. That Cup run gave the team such confidence that we could be on the same pitch as the big boys. It was a wonderful experience. \\"Sinton got sold on the back of that game [to QPR]. He was obviously a good player but showed he could handle it with the big boys.\\" Brentford are currently third in League One, where they have only lost four times all season. Their defeat by Tranmere Rovers last Saturday was their first at Griffin Park since August and up front they have Clayton Donaldson, who has scored 19 goals in all competitions so far this term. But Chelsea legend Ron Harris, who played 795 games for the Blues before taking up a player-coach role with Brentford in 1980, cannot see an upset despite being impressed with the Bees when he saw them beat Southend to tee up the Chelsea tie. Chelsea were beaten 4-0 by Barnsley in the FA Cup third round in the 1988-89 season but went on to win the old Division Two title. The Blues reached their first FA Cup final in 24 years in 1994 but were brushed aside 4-0 at Wembley by a Manchester United side who clinched the double with that emphatic victory. Chelsea won the 1997 FA Cup final, their first major trophy in 27 years and their second FA Cup success. Since then they have won the competition five further times, in 2000, 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2012. They have won the FA Cup in four of the last six seasons, and have appeared in six of the 13 finals this century. Chelsea v Manchester United 1994 FA Cup final \\"They looked a half-decent side,\\" Harris told BBC Sport. \\"Rosler has got them playing some decent football. \\"Brentford are not an up-and-under, blowing-the-bugle type team and they played it around pretty well. But actually that will probably suit Chelsea more. \\"It's a fantastic tie for Brentford. You get upsets every year but I just cannot see it in this game. \\"Brentford would have to play out of their skin to beat Chelsea and Chelsea would have to play very poorly.\\" Notts County coach Colin Lee, a former Chelsea and Bees player, has been impressed with League One rivals Brentford this season, but cannot see an upset despite the turmoil at Stamford Bridge and the supporters' anger at Rafael Benitez's appointment as manager. \\"Chelsea will put out a very strong team. Brentford deserve that but I think Chelsea will have too much for them,\\" he said. Lee joined Brentford from the Blues in 1987 and combined playing duties with a first foray into management as a youth team coach. And although he was not involved in the game at Anfield, he was still on the playing staff and fondly recalls his spell with the Bees and the excitement that Cup run created. Ron Harris, Micky Droy, Keith Jones, Tommy Baldwin, Colin Lee, Steve Sidwell, Joe Allon, Graham Wilkins, Peter Borota and Stewart Houston. \\"It's a great club,\\" Lee said. \\"I had a fantastic couple of years there.

Question: Information: - Enrico Fermi (29 September 1901 28 November 1954) was an Italian physicist, who created the world's first nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1. He has been called the \\"architect of the nuclear age\\" and the \\"architect of the atomic bomb\\". He was one of the few physicists to excel both theoretically and experimentally. Fermi held several patents related to the use of nuclear power, and was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity by neutron bombardment and the discovery of transuranic elements. He made significant contributions to the development of quantum theory, nuclear and particle physics, and statistical mechanics. - Induced radioactivity occurs when a previously stable material has been made radioactive by exposure to specific radiation. Most radioactivity does not induce other material to become radioactive. This Induced radioactivity was discovered by Irène Curie and F. Joliot in 1934 and received the Nobel Prize in 1935 for this discovery. This is also known as man-made radioactivity. The phenomenon by which even light elements are made radioactive by artificial or induced methods is called artificial radioactivity. - Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1), when it achieved criticality, became the world's first artificial nuclear reactor. Its construction was part of the Manhattan Project, the Allied effort to create atomic bombs during World War II. It was built by the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago, under the west viewing stands of the original Stagg Field. The first human-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was initiated in CP-1 on 2 December 1942, under the supervision of Enrico Fermi, who described the apparatus as \\"a crude pile of black bricks and wooden timbers\\". - A chemist (from Greek chm (ía) alchemy + -ist; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchimista) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties. The word 'chemist' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English. - Alchemy is a philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout Europe, Egypt and Asia. It aimed to purify, mature, and perfect certain objects. Common aims were chrysopoeia, the transmutation of \\"base metals\\" (e.g., lead) into \\"noble\\" ones (particularly gold); the creation of an elixir of immortality; the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease; and the development of an alkahest, a universal solvent. The perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and, in the Hellenistic and western tradition, the achievement of gnosis. In Europe, the creation of a philosopher's stone was variously connected with all of these projects. - Oscar D'Agostino ( 29 August 1901 -- 16 March 1975 ) was an Italian chemist and one of the so - called Via Panisperna boys , the group of young scientists led by Enrico Fermi : all of them were physicists , except for D'Agostino , who was a chemist . In 1934 he contributed to Fermi 's experiment ( that gave Fermi the possibility to win the Nobel Prize in 1938 ) to showing the properties of slow neutrons . That led the way to the discovery of nuclear fission , and later on to the construction of the first atomic bomb . - The Nobel Prize in Physics is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who conferred the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. - The Via Panisperna boys (Italian: \\"I ragazzi di Via Panisperna\\") were a group of young scientists led by Enrico Fermi. In Rome in 1934, they made the famous discovery of slow neutrons which later made possible the nuclear reactor, and then the construction of the first atomic bomb. - Pharmacists, also known as chemists (Commonwealth English) or druggists (North American and, archaically, Commonwealth English), are healthcare professionals who practice in pharmacy, the field of health sciences focusing on safe and effective medication use. A pharmacist is a member of the health care team directly involved with patient care. Pharmacists undergo university-level education to understand the biochemical mechanisms and actions of drugs, drug uses, therapeutic roles, side effects, potential drug interactions, and monitoring parameters. This is mated to anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. Pharmacists interpret and communicate this specialized knowledge to patients, physicians, and other health care providers.

Article:Jack Adcock, six, died of a cardiac arrest at Leicester Royal Infirmary after he developed sepsis in 2011. Sepsis management was one of several concerns raised by health inspectors. Doctor Hadiza Bawa-Garba and nurse Isabel Amaro were convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence last year at Nottingham Crown Court. Jack, who had Down's syndrome and a heart condition, was admitted to the hospital with vomiting and diarrhoea. He died 11 hours later from a cardiac arrest caused by sepsis triggered by pneumonia. A trial heard the boy's death was caused by \\"serious neglect\\" by staff who failed to recognise his body was \\"shutting down\\" and close to death. Now a Care Quality Commission (CQC) report into the hospital's emergency department, published on 7 April, has found sepsis clinical pathways were in place, but were not always completed for patients despite evidence of escalating \\"early warning scores\\". Inspectors reported two incidents of staff failing to recognise sepsis or the severity of the condition. In one instance, there was a misdiagnosis of sepsis by a junior doctor of a patient who had a blood clot in a leg which had travelled to a lung. The report also found patients arriving on ambulances were not handed over in a \\"timely manner\\", and the \\"skill mix\\" of nursing staff was not always appropriate to meet patient needs. Jack's mother, Nicola Adcock, from Glen Parva, Leicestershire, said she was previously given assurances procedures were being put in place to tackle problems with sepsis care at the hospital. \\"It's disgusting, it's shocking, it should never happen,\\" she said. \\"I've heard so many stories since Jack, so are they putting things in? Why are they not being adhered to? \\"Nobody will ever understand what we've gone through.\\" Speaking on behalf of Leicester Royal Infirmary, chief nurse Julie Smith said on Friday that it was \\"completely accepted\\" at the time of the inspection that the hospital must do better. She said the hospital now reports back to the CQC every week over sepsis care. The CQC said it served a notice imposing conditions on the registration of the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust - which runs the hospital - after the inspection.

The government takes a certain percentage of the toys made by the toy makers and distributes them to the kids who need them through various programs. Question 2: The procurement of rice under the levy system is how the government gets rice from farmers, just like the toys example. Imagine that instead of toys, the farmers are growing rice plants. The government tells the farmers that they have to give a certain amount of rice from their harvest to the government. The government then uses this rice to help feed people who need it through different programs.

Start with the given equation: -3109*n - 395722 = -153220 2. Your goal is to isolate 'n'. So, the first move is to get rid of the 395722 on the left side of the equation. To do this, add 395722 to both sides of the equation: -3109*n - 395722 + 395722 = -153220 + 395722 This simplifies to: -3109*n = 242502 3. Now, you will need to get rid of the coefficient (-3109) in front of the 'n' to isolate 'n'. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by -3109: (-3109*n) / -3109 = 242502 / -3109 4. Performing the division on both sides will give you the value of 'n': n = -78 So, the solution to the equation -3109*n - 395722 = -153220 is n = -78."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"No, the suggested answer does not directly address the question of which came first: the army or the air force. Instead, it discusses the functions and responsibilities of Headquarters AAF during early air force operations. A more appropriate response to the question would involve a brief historical overview of the development of both forces. To answer the question, we can look back on the history of military organization and modern armed forces. The concept of an organized and trained army dates back thousands of years, with early examples including the Egyptian, Hittite, and Assyrian armies that existed during the ancient period. These ground troops were the foundation of military defense and offense for much of human history. The development of the air force, on the other hand, is a more recent occurrence in history. The use of air power for military purposes only became possible with the invention of machines capable of sustained and controlled flight, such as airplanes and airships. The first air forces began to appear at the onset of the 20th century, with the Italian and French air forces being the pioneers of aerial combat during World War I. In the United States, the United States Army Air Service (USAAS) was established during World War I, but it functioned as a part of the army. It later became the United States Army Air Corps and then the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). It wasn't until 1947 that the United States Air Force (USAF) was officially formed as a separate branch of the military, independent from the army. In conclusion, the army was established long before the air force, as the development of organized, trained ground troops predate the invention and adaptation of air power for military purposes. You should reject the suggested answer because it does not address the question about which came first and instead focuses on a specific aspect of early air force operations. A better answer would be: \\"The army came first historically, with the concept of organized ground troops dating back thousands of years to ancient civilizations. The air force is a more recent development, appearing at the onset of the 20th century with the invention of machines capable of sustained, controlled flight and their subsequent adaptation for military purposes.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A wander through the market like any other becomes, in spring time, a new experience. I feel like a fresh arrival, like it’s my first time walking through my local market. There are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany’s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily. Rarely the rounded globe artichokes you find spilling out of crates in Rome, or the tiny, delicate Venetian ones, the so-called castraure (though they often aren’t the real deal, how you can tell is by the price) that you can find in the shadow of the Rialto. And then there are thick bunches of agretti (salsola soda), looking more like mermaid’s hair than a monk’s beard, their English namesake. A few years ago, this wasn’t such a common sight at the market in Florence.

Emily is the smoker. Based on the information provided in the sentence, we can deduce that Emily currently has a bad cough, whereas Victoria does not. One possible reason that Emily may have a bad cough is due to smoking. Smoking is known to cause respiratory issues and can lead to various health problems, including persistent coughing. It is not uncommon for smokers to have a bad cough as a result of their habit. In this context, the fact that Victoria doesn't have a bad cough can be interpreted as an indication that she is less likely to be a smoker than Emily, as she is not displaying this specific symptom usually associated with smoking. It is important to note, however, that there may be other factors contributing to Emily's cough, and it is not definitive evidence that she is a smoker. It is also possible that Victoria is a smoker but does not currently have a cough. To further support the idea that Emily is the smoker, we can look at other contextual factors. If, for example, Emily has mentioned in the past that she smokes or has been seen smoking, this evidence would strengthen the argument that Emily is the smoker in this scenario. Additionally, any other known health issues or environmental factors that could be causing Emily's cough should be considered, as this may change the likelihood that her cough is due to smoking. In conclusion, the sentence suggests that Emily has a higher likelihood of being the smoker due to her current bad cough, a symptom often associated with smoking, and the fact that Victoria doesn't have a cough lowers the probability of her being a smoker.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Review: 2011 Honda Odyssey Oh Generations X and Y, you think you are so cool with your extreme sports and your vampires. Well, guess what? You’re turning into your parents just like everyone does eventually. After an SUV tax break-driven slump, minivan sales are on the rise again as children of the 1980’s and 1990’s start families of their own and reminisce about the good old days when they made mom drop them off down the block from school so that their friends wouldn’t see them getting out of the Dodge Caravan with the fake wood paneling. Apparently, the functional charms of such vehicles were so strong that they became subliminally ingrained into the minds of these otherwise embarrassed youths like the lyrics of a heavy metal song. It’s a phenomenon that partly explains Honda’s decision to use a riff from the “The Hellion” by Judas Priest in one of its commercials for the 2011 Odyssey. “Heading Out to the Highway” must’ve already been taken. In any case, somewhere there's a leather-clad fallen angel weeping. This isn’t to say that every 20 to 30-something is flocking to the box. The marketing team at Honda has indentified a demographic that it calls “hesitators” who are attracted to the practicality of a minivan, but can’t stomach the image it bestows upon them. This is why the automaker has worked hard to change that impression. Perhaps too hard. The new Odyssey is longer, lower and wider than the model it replaces, and features a subtle take on the armored-up style recently seen on cars from Honda’s luxury division, Acura. Its most distinctive element is the “lightning bolt” belt line that zigzags under the rearmost side windows, drawing the attention of passers-by while giving third row passengers a better view out of the extended glass. Nearly as prominent are the tracks for the sliding rear doors. They are so wide that if you leave the Odyssey parked outside too long you may find troublemaking teenagers storing their contraband in them. Honda says it hasn’t tried to hide the gap in the bottom of the window frame like other companies do so that it doesn’t impinge on shoulder room, but you know it's really all about the bolt. It’s not just the third row that gets this sort of spatial consideration, however. There is so much width available in the second row that Honda had to figure out what to do with all of it. The answer? Wide Mode, which allows the outboard seats to be slid sideways to make lots of room for three well-fed American types, or a trio of full-size child seats. The center hump even shuffles forward half a foot to make it easier for the front seat passenger turn around and wipe baby’s mouth – assuming that her husband got stuck sitting back there. As you’d expect from the second best-selling minivan nameplate in America (congratulations Chrysler Town and Country), amenities are plentiful across the seven trim levels of the Odyssey that start at 28,580 and run up to 44,030. Sure, having only 15 cup and bottle holders means that one of the eight people on board will have to make due with just one Big Gulp, but there’s also a cool box located in the bottom of the dashboard that can fit a six pack. When you’re done with your drinks, a ring pops out from the back of the center console that can be used to hold a small garbage bag for the trash. Above it – in the top-level Touring Elite model, at least – you’ll find an entertainment system mounted to the ceiling that may look strangely familiar. This is because the 16.2-inch Ultrawide monitor is the same as the one in the Toyota Sienna. Honda has packaged it into a unique pod that includes two speakers and a rechargeable remote control. The screen itself can be split to display images from two different sources simultaneously, and the system includes an HDMI input and wireless headphones. Of course the folks in the front seats are left out of the fun and stuck with having to enjoy the spoken-word version of “Despicable Me” because the safety patrol won’t let the 8-inch screen for the navigation system play movies on the move. This is fine for the driver – if not the one riding shotgun - because the Odyssey offers other, more dynamic forms of entertainment. Fox Car Report is on Twitter. Follow us @foxcarreport The six-cylinder engine in the Odyssey gets a modest 4 horsepower bump in output to 248 horsepower, but it is plenty. A five-speed automatic transmission is standard, but Touring models get a six-speed that not only makes better use of the power on hand, but also increases fuel economy from 18 mpg city/27 mpg highway to 19/28. That’s crazy good efficiency for such a large car. In fact, it’s the best of any eight-passenger vehicle currently on sale. The Odyssey achieves it by running the engine on just four our three cylinders when all six aren’t necessary. The system is seamless in its operation, aided by active noise-canceling technology that counteracts any unbalanced sounds coming from under the hood. Noises and warning lights that you may be more interested in are activated by front and rear proximity sensors that keep you from running into things a low speeds and a blind spot information system for when you need to change lanes. Active cruise control is not available, but the rear backup camera has three views – Normal, Wide (what’s up with this wide stuff?) and Top-Down. Unfortunately, its location makes it particularly susceptible to being obscured by mud and snow. Despite being so fully outfitted for suburban family battle, it’s a pleasant surprise to find that Odyssey is actually a good drive, too. The ride is so controlled that you can easily find yourself doing things with it on twisty roads that aren’t typically advisable in such a large, tall vehicle. Nevertheless, a five-star crash test rating – including top marks in for rollovers – means that you are well-protected in the event that you do manage to overstep its limits. At more parental speeds the richly-appointed cabin is almost luxury-sedan quiet and the fully-independent suspension as smooth as the engine. It’s almost enough to make you forget sedans and coupes even exist. Better yet, when the mid-life crisis hits in a couple of years and you buy a convertible to go with your implants – hair or otherwise – you can give the kids the Odyssey to use for High School. Yea, they’ll hate you for it, but it’ll be perfect for carrying around the equipment for their rebellious-youth garage band. If they’re good enough, maybe one day they’ll do the soundtrack for a station wagon commercial. They’re coming back, too, you know. And the cycle of life continues.

Honda's innovative design works to change the traditional minivan image often associated with previous generations. The new Odyssey, with a wider, lower, and longer frame than its predecessor, offers increased space and comfort. This is particularly evident in the second row, which features a 'Wide Mode' allowing the seats to slide sideways in order to offer more space. Additional notable features of the 2011 Odyssey include the large tracks for its sliding rear doors, an abundant 15 cup and bottle holders and a cool box conveniently placed at the bottom of the dashboard for storage. It also boasts an entertainment system housed in a unique pod, featuring a 16.2-inch Ultrawide monitor, two speakers, and a rechargeable remote control. Powered by a six-cylinder engine with an output of 248 horsepower, the Odyssey balances this raw power with fuel efficiency, achieving 18 mpg city/27 mpg highway in its standard model, and 19 mpg city/28 mpg highway with its Touring model. Its efficiency is further bolstered by smart technology that only runs the required number of engine cylinders and uses active noise-cancelling technology to counteract imbalanced sounds. Safety aspects are also well-addressed in the 2011 Odyssey. The vehicle features front and rear proximity sensors and a blind spot information system. A rear backup camera provides three view options, and the car's five-star crash test rating includes top marks for rollovers. Overall, the 2011 Honda Odyssey provides a good driving experience along with robust features, thoughtful design and a consideration for safety, striking a balance between the dynamism of a sedan and the practicality of a minivan."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The interesting fact about them wast that, while Twin I had a very cold water all year, Twin II lake had very warm waters year round. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which body of water had fewer problems in the vicinity of industrial discharge ? Hint: The temperature of a body of water directly affects the amount of dissolved oxygen it can hold. Following Henry's law, as water becomes warmer, oxygen becomes less soluble in it. This property leads to daily anoxic cycles on small geographic scales and seasonal cycles of anoxia on the larger scale. Thus, bodies of water are more vulnerable to anoxic conditions during warmest period of the day and during the summer months. This problem can be further exacerbated in the vicinity of industrial discharge where warm water used to cool machinery is less able to hold oxygen than the basin to which it is released. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information given and taking into account Henry's Law, the body of water with fewer problems in the vicinity of industrial discharge would be Twin I lake. This is because Twin I lake has very cold water all year round, which means it can hold more dissolved oxygen compared to warmer water, making it less vulnerable to anoxic conditions caused by industrial discharge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is \\"Supporters have also argued that DST decreases energy consumption by reducing the need for lighting and heating, but the actual effect on overall energy use is heavily disputed.\\" a good answer to the question \\"Do those who favor DST say people would rather have an extra hour of daylight before or after their usual workday?\\"","completion":"No, that statement does not directly answer the question about people's preference for an extra hour of daylight before or after their usual workday. A detailed and long answer for the given question would be: Supporters of Daylight Saving Time (DST) generally believe that people would prefer to have an extra hour of daylight after their usual workday. Extending daylight into the evening is one of the main reasons behind the concept of DST. By moving the clock forward one hour in the spring, as observed in many countries, the amount of evening daylight increases, while the amount of daylight in the morning decreases. The primary argument in favor of DST is based on the premise that people would utilize the additional daylight during leisure activities, which usually happen after working hours. This extended evening daylight can promote healthier lifestyles by encouraging people to engage in outdoor activities such as sports, exercise, and recreation. Extended evening daylight also benefits retail businesses, as it tends to encourage more shopping. The statement you provided addresses the energy consumption aspect of DST. Advocates posit that it can reduce the need for lighting and heating, and thus decrease overall energy consumption. This argument also contributes to the belief that people would prefer having an extra hour of daylight in the evenings, as it may lead to significant cost savings and environmental benefits. However, it should be noted that the actual impact of DST on energy use, as well as the preferences of individuals in relation to daylight hours, is subjective and varies based on factors such as location, climate, and individual habits. As the statement suggests, the effect of DST on overall energy consumption is heavily disputed, with some research indicating minimal or no significant savings in energy usage, and in some cases, even an increase in energy consumption. In summary, while the statement you provided does not directly address the question, it is important to understand that those who favor DST generally believe that people would prefer having an extra hour of daylight after their usual workday. The underlying rationale is that this extra daylight would promote healthier and more active lifestyles, benefit businesses, and potentially reduce energy consumption. However, it is essential to consider that the actual effect on energy use and personal preferences varies and remains a topic of debate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Later in the 3rd quarter, Bears cornerback Charles Tillman forced a fumble, which Lance Briggs picked up and returned for a 21-yard touchdown. The Bears defense was able to contain the Colts the rest of the way, including a key fourth down and one yard stop near midfield early in the fourth quarter. The Bears essentially sealed their victory with 8:56 left on a one-yard touchdown run by fullback Jason McKie. After the game, Al Michaels and John Madden awarded Forte with the Sunday Night Football's \\"Horse Trailer Player of the Game\\" award.

Is the Court Being Thoughtful or Partisan? Richard A. Epstein, N.Y.U. School of Law Shifting responsibility to the states would help protect individual liberty, sorely needed in a health care system suffocating under national regimentation. Elizabeth Wydra, Constitutional Accountability Center Two conservative court of appeals judges provided compelling, conservative arguments for the mandate’s constitutionality. Should the court uphold this onerous statute, Congress will ever after be allowed to dictate private activities of citizens — well beyond the enumerated powers in the Constitution. Kermit Roosevelt III, author, \\"The Myth of Judicial Activism\\" It's a straightforward case, but by spending extra time on it the justices may placate the losing side. James F. Blumstein, Vanderbilt Law School The law would be a bait and switch, changing the rules, and adding to states' burdens after they agreed to Medicaid's conditions. Ilya Somin, George Mason University School of Law If Congress can regulate the failure to purchase insurance, there would be no limits to its power. What was this article about?","completion":"This article features a collection of opinions from various law experts and authors concerning the role of the court in evaluating the constitutionality of a healthcare mandate, specifically, whether the court's approach is thoughtful or partisan. They discuss the implications of the court's decision on individual liberty, national regulation, and the balance of power between the federal government and the states. Richard A. Epstein argues that shifting healthcare responsibility to states would protect individual liberty amidst national regimentation. In contrast, Elizabeth Wydra highlights the conservative arguments for the mandate's constitutionality. A fear expressed by some, including an anonymous contributor, is that if the court upholds this statute, Congress's power over citizens' private activities would expand, going beyond the enumerated powers in the Constitution. Kermit Roosevelt III believes that the case is straightforward but suggests that the justices may be extending the discussion to placate the losing side. James F. Blumstein argues that the law is a bait-and-switch tactic, burdening states with additional responsibilities. Lastly, Ilya Somin asserts that allowing Congress to regulate the failure to purchase insurance would result in an unlimited expansion of its power. In summary, the article presents various perspectives on whether the court is acting thoughtfully or through partisan bias in its examination of a healthcare mandate's constitutionality and its broader implications for individual liberties, state power, and congressional authority."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Republican Cory Gardner has opened up a four-point lead in a Colorado Senate race that's key in determining whether Democrats can hold onto their majority, a new CNN/ORC poll shows. Gardner held a 50 percent to 46 percent edge on first-term Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in the survey of 665 likely voters, conducted Oct. 9-13. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points. Republicans have targeted Udall and several other Democratic incumbents in their effort to win at least six seats this fall -- enough to gain a Senate majority for President Barack Obama's final two years in office.

For JKB, this, and her inability to have children, is a problem. Gajapathi (Janagaraj) works for JKB as a tambura musician, and he is a compulsive liar. The film starts with an introduction of all characters of the film followed by JKB going to a concert where he finds Gurumoorthy (Delhi Ganesh), who works for JKB as a Mridangam musician, drunk.

While your given statement provides a partially accurate description of some of the events that occurred in northern Burma, it doesn't specifically mention the time when the Chinese invaded the region. The Burma Campaign was a series of battles fought in the British colony of Burma, between the Allied forces (primarily British, Indian, Chinese, and American) and the Japanese Empire. The campaign took place from December 1941 to August 1945. The invasion of northern Burma by the Chinese forces happened in several stages: 1. First Stage (1942): Following the Japanese invasion of Burma in December 1941, the Chinese Expeditionary Force entered the northern part of the country in early 1942 to support the retreating British and Indian forces. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek sent the Fifth Army and Sixth Army, both of which were deployed successfully to slow down the rapid Japanese advance into the country. However, this initial attempt was hard-going for the Chinese, and they couldn't turn back the Japanese forces until they met with strong reinforcements. 2. Second Stage (1943-1944): The Chinese forces launched several counteroffensives into northern Burma in 1943. These were aided by US General Joseph Stilwell's force (also known as \\"X Force\\") and the British Chindits, which were long range penetration groups operating behind the Japanese lines. However, these efforts were not enough to reclaim the lost territories and expel the Japanese from the region. 3. Third Stage (1944-1945): The major Chinese invasion of northern Burma occurred in late 1944 and early 1945 through a series of operations collectively known as Operation Grubworm. This was conducted in conjunction with the US-led Northern Combat Area Command (NCAC) and other Allied forces, which included British, Indian, and African troops. The joint alliance focused on opening the Ledo-Burma Road to create a supply route between Burma and China. The operations to capture and control northern Burma by the Chinese and Allied forces were ultimately successful, pushing the Japanese forces out and opening the route by February 1945. In conclusion, the Chinese invasion of northern Burma took place during various stages between 1942 and 1945, with the main invasion occurring in late 1944 and early 1945. The given statement contains information related to the events that took place in northern Burma during the campaign but doesn't accurately specify the time of the Chinese invasion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The farther the material is stretched or compressed, the greater the elastic force becomes.

Elastic materials, such as a bungee cord, are able to return to their original shape after being stretched or compressed due to their property of elasticity. Step 1: Compare the elastic force when the bungee cord is stretched partially and when it is stretched completely. - When the bungee cord is stretched partially, the elastic force opposing the stretching will be less compared to when it is stretched completely. - When the bungee cord is stretched completely, the elastic force opposing the stretching will be greater compared to when it is stretched partially. Step 2: Determine which scenario of stretching the bungee cord results in greater resistance. - Based on the comparison in Step 1, the bungee cord will resist further stretching more when it is stretched completely than when it is stretched partially due to the greater elastic force. The answer to this question is: The bungee cord will resist further stretching more when it's stretched completely as opposed to when it's stretched partially, because the elastic force becomes greater as the material is stretched further."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The three Kansas militiamen planned to blow up an apartment complex housing Somali refugees during the 2016 presidential election, unleashing what one of them called \\"Crusades 2.0.\\" But their plan was foiled after their arrest just weeks before the election, highlighting the changing enemy list of a movement founded on the back of anti-government activism a generation ago. And with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support, the urge to confront the government appears to have lost some of its urgency. Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa. \\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group. Often lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms. There are the \\"preppers,\\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest. There are the \\"survivalists,\\" people who learn skills to “live off the land” in case of a disaster. There are “sovereign citizens” such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow. And then there are the militiamen who conduct regular military-style training to resist a government they see as engaged in a global plot to take away their guns and constitutional rights. The modern militia movement dates back to a series of events in the early 1990s, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Among them: the 1992 election of Democratic President Bill Clinton and an FBI attack the following year on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, an event seen as \\"evidence of an out of control government willing to attack citizens.\\" Under Clinton, the number... how do militia groups feel about Donald Trump?

S. presidents had experiences in the army. The two best known were Ulysses Grant and Dwight D. Eisenhower. Grant was a general in the American Civil War and Eisenhower was a hero in the Second World War. It happened that they graduated from the same school--West Point Military Academy . One may be surprised to learn that both of them did not do well in the school. Eisenhower, for example, was once fined because he broke the rules of the school. The jobs of U.

Movie title: Buried Movie plot: On October 23, 2006, Paul Conroy, an American civilian truck driver working in Iraq, wakes up and finds himself buried alive in a wooden coffin, bound and gagged, with only a Zippo lighter and a BlackBerry phone at hand. Although he initially has no idea how he got there, he starts to piece together what has happened to him. He remembers that his and several other trucks were ambushed by terrorists, who killed his colleagues; he was hit by a rock and passed out. He receives a call from his kidnapper, Jabir, demanding that he pay a ransom of 5 million by 9PM or he will be left in the coffin to die. Conroy calls the State Department, which tells him that due to the government policy of not negotiating with terrorists, it will not pay the ransom but will try to rescue him. They connect him with Dan Brenner, head of the Hostage Working Group, who tells Conroy they are doing their best to find him. His kidnapper calls Conroy and demands he make a ransom video, threatening to execute one of his colleagues who survived the attack. Conroy insists that no one will pay 5 million, so the kidnapper drops the amount to 1 million. Despite his compliance in making a video, the kidnappers execute his colleague and send him the recording of it, which he watches in horror. Shortly afterwards, distant explosions shake the area, damaging his coffin, which begins to slowly fill with sand. Conroy continues sporadic phone calls with Brenner, skeptical of the man's promises of help. To reaffirm his wholehearted intentions, Brenner tells Conroy about a 26-year-old named Mark White who was rescued from a similar situation three weeks previously, telling him that the kid is home with his family and happy. Later on, Conroy receives a phone call from his employers, who inform him that he was fired from his job due to an alleged prohibited relationship with a colleague (the one who was executed), and thus he and his family will not be entitled to any benefits or pension he earned during his time with the company.

Here's the step-by-step process: 1. Combine the terms with n. The equation is 617*n + 108*n - 1236*n + 18907 = 0. 2. Add the coefficients of the n terms. (617 + 108 - 1236) * n + 18907 = 0 (-511) * n + 18907 = 0 3. To solve for n, isolate n by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation. -511 * n = -18907 4. Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of n (-511) to find the value of n. n = -18907 / -511 5.

Movie title: Shoot to Kill Movie plot: This article needs an improved plot summary. (May 2015) A man is discovered breaking into his own jewellery shop in the dead of night. Questioned closely, it is discovered that his wife is being held hostage at their home by Steve, a brutal extortionist who demands the diamonds in the shop's safe in exchange for the woman's life. After Steve kills the family maid, FBI agent Warren Stantin (Sidney Poitier) hands over the diamonds, but Steve kills the jeweller's wife anyway, and escapes. Feeling that he has failed, Stantin becomes obsessed with finding Steve, and he chases Steve into the rugged forests of the state of Washington, where Steve joins up with a group of sportsmen who plan to trek into the wilderness on a fishing trip. Steve's plan is to kill them and force their guide, Sarah (Kirstie Alley), to lead him through the wilderness to the CanadaâUS border. Stantin must team up with Sarah's mountain-man boyfriend Jonathan Knox (Tom Berenger) to pursue Steve. Jonathan does not believe city slicker Stantin can keep up on a tough cross-country hike that includes some rock climbing, and Stantin is determined to prove himself. They pursue Steve and Sarah into the wilderness and eventually to the streets of Vancouver. The movie also featured a chase scene aboard the BC Ferries Queen of Vancouver. After a long chase, Stantin manages to shoot Steve in an underwater struggle. The killer's identity is not revealed until midway through the film. He attempts to evade detection by killing a member of a hiking expedition and taking his place. To keep the audience guessing as to the true identity of the villain, some of the hikers were played by actors known for playing bad guys: notably Clancy Brown (Highlander), Frederick Coffin (Mother's Day), Andrew Robinson (Dirty Harry) and Richard Masur (the vicious drug dealer in Who'll Stop the Rain).

Amanda Knox has become engaged to a 27-year-old musician who wrote to her while she was in an Italian prison. The 27-year-old will reportedly marry Colin Sutherland, who Knox has known since middle school. But as their families celebrate in Washington, a legal back and forth continues in Italy as Knox and her co-defendant and ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito fight back against their 2014 re-conviction by an Italian upper court for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher. Engaged! Amanda Knox (right) is reportedly engaged to her childhood friend, musician Colin Sutherland (left) The news of Knox's engagement was first reported in a Seattle Times column on Wednesday. Columnist Jonathan Martin writes that Knox confirmed the engagement to him via email buut said no more. The pair were engaged last week. No date has been set for the nuptials. Before her current love was revealed in September, Knox was known to be living in Seattle with her classical guitarist then-boyfriend James Terrano. A LinkedIn profile for Sutherland once listed his name as Thunderstrike after the Marvel comic-book character - says he studied French at Sarah Lawrence Sutherland once lived in Brooklyn but has since moved back to Seattle, where he and Knox attended middle school. Sutherland once lived in Brooklyn but has since moved back to Seattle, where he and Knox attended middle school. Here, Knox is pictured with Sutherland in New York during a visit in July Sealed with a kiss: Sutherland (again seen here with Knox during her visit to New York as they locked lips at Coney Island) and Knox reported were engaged last week Childhood friend: Sutherland reportedly wrote to Knox as she sat in an Italian prison following her 2009 conviction. The pair have known each other since middle school She was set to graduate from the University of Washington this past June with a degree in creative writing. She's now working at a Seattle bookstore and as a writer for the West Seattle Herald. Meanwhile, her case is headed back into the Italian courts once again following an initial conviction, an overturning of that conviction followed by her reconviction along with Sollecito. It seems unlikely Knox, who now lives in the U.S, will ever be returned to jail for the crime as she has repeatedly refused to return to Italy. If she is convicted again, Italy is likely to request to extradite her but her longstanding battle to prove her innocence has made her a cause célèbre in the U.S who may ignore political pressure to send her back. Sollecito and Knox were first found guilty of murder in November 2009. The previous man: Knox was last known before Sutherland to be dating classical guitarist James Terrano, who she reportedly lived with in Seattle, Washington The killers' convictions were later quashed after experts said forensic evidence had been contaminated and they were released. Prosecutors then appealed that finding and the case was re-tried in March 2013. In January last year a court upheld the original verdict, but the pair remained at large as under Italy's legal system, any verdict reached after a second appeal but be ratified by the highest court. Since the last verdict, Sollecito, 30, has stayed in Italy. He was ordered to remain there after being found near the Italian border with Slovenia and Austria hours after being found guilty for the second time. He has since completed a degree in information technology. Back then: Knox was accused along with her then boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito (both at left) of brutally murdering Knox's roommate in Perugia, Italy Meredith Kercher, 21 (right) in 2007 Kercher, 21, was found dead on the floor of her bedroom. Some of her belongings were missing and Knox reported an apparent burglary to police. Detectives concluded the supposed break-in looked staged and Knox became the prime suspect. She then implicated Patrick Lumumba, a bar owner she worked for. The duo were arrested along with Sollecito. Mr Lumumba was later released when evidence pointed to Rudy Guede's involvement. Guede was then accused of committing the murder along with Sollecito and Knox. In October 2008 he was found guilty of sexually assaulting and murdering Kercher. Home for good: While it's highly unlikely that Knox would be extradited no matter what happens in court in March, her ex Raffaele Sollecito must face the music in his home country ||||| Originally published February 11, 2015 at 3:45 PM | Page modified February 11, 2015 at 5:25 PM Amanda Knox got engaged last week. For an ordinary 27-year-old Seattleite, a wedding would be a pivot to a new life. The future Mr. Knox is Colin Sutherland, also 27, a musician who recently moved to Seattle from New York. They’ve known each other since middle school. Best of luck, and happy Valentine’s Day. But Knox’s life is extraordinary, for all the wrong reasons. Married or not, Knox’s future is frozen at Nov. 2, 2007, the day her roommate, Meredith Kercher, was found brutally slain just at the start of Knox’s junior year abroad in Italy. Since then, Knox’s case has pinballed through the Italian judicial system in ways that baffles many Americans. In quick summary: Knox returned home to West Seattle in 2011 after her murder conviction was reversed on appeal. That decision was appealed by prosecutors, and she and her ex-boyfriend were re-convicted in 2014. The case takes another turn March 25 this year, when Italy’s Court of Cassation, its highest court, hears yet another appeal of an appeal, and decides whether Italy may seek to force Knox back for another trial. Knox has sought to keep a low profile since returning, despite bouts of paparazzi stalking that yielded pictures of her and Sutherland, a lanky rock musician. Her engagement was disclosed by a source close to the family, and Knox confirmed it in an email, but declined to say anything else. I met Knox for coffee late last year at a West Seattle café, on her condition it would be off-the-record. She’d recently graduated from the University of Washington, finishing the degree interrupted by her four years in prison, and had begun writing for the West Seattle Herald. She works at a bookstore. As we talked about journalism, she struck me as a normal would-be writer — earnest, well-read, a bit of a goofy sense of humor. When I brought up her pending case, she shut down entirely. I don’t blame her. The killing of her roommate spawned an industry of websites and message boards. The fine grains of evidence are sifted and re-sifted through nearly every possible lens — American entitlement, Italian buffoonery, female sexual power, male prosecutorial abuse, and so on. Race plays a role because Knox falsely accused a black Italian man before recanting, a serious mistake she apologized for in her memoir. And then there’s Rudy Guede, who was convicted separately in Kercher’s death. Despite credible evidence pointing to him as the sole culprit, Guede could be released before Knox’s fate is determined. Friends and sources consistently ask me about Knox, whose case I’ve covered off and on since 2007. To believe she’s innocent, you have to simply be willing to believe that prosecutors get stuck with tunnel vision, and that Italian judges are fallible political animals. It is telling that prosecutors’ sensational theory about Kercher’s death — a sex game gone awry — was abandoned in the latest court ruling, in favor of a more pedestrian case of roommate squabbling. None of these theories holds up. It is a highly circumstantial case, with DNA evidence so thin that Knox probably wouldn’t have even been charged in the United States. The prosecution’s shifting theories reflect the fact that Knox had no motive. She might be America’s most famous wrongfully convicted person. The March 25 hearing in Italy could result in her acquittal. Many of Knox’s supporters instead fear she and ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito could be sent back for yet another trial. Knox has said publicly she has no intention of voluntarily returning to Italy. An extradition process would be legally difficult to avoid and painfully expensive for her family, but I suspect members of Washington’s congressional delegation will make it into a political fight. Until then, if Seattleites see Knox around town, give her a smile and maybe a congratulations on her engagement. (No date has been set, according to my source.) Her husband-to-be wrote her while she was in prison, and now he has signed up to be stalked by paparazzi, British tabloids and Internet trolls. It must be love.

Because it involves a group's shared opinion of you, reputation change will take time. If you find yourself struggling with patience as you work to change your reputation, remind yourself that your reputation isn't either mature or immature like a light switch is on or off, but is instead on a continuum that varies in maturity, like a light dimmer switch that goes from very bright all the way down to off.

Input: Review: First love is a desperately difficult subject to pull off convincingly in cinema : the all-encompassing passion involved generally ends up as a pale imitation or, worse, slightly ridiculous.Lifshitz manages to avoid all the pitfalls and delivers a moving, sexy, thoroughly engrossing tale of love, disaster and possible redemption, while tangentially touching on some of the deeper themes in human existence.The core story is of Mathieu, 18, a solitary, introverted boy who meets Cédric, brasher, more outgoing but just as lonely, while on holiday with his family. As the summer warms on, they fall in love and, when the holidays end, decide to live together. A year later, the relationship ends in catastrophe: Cédric cheats on Mathieu who, distraught, tries to take his own life. He survives and, in order to get perspective back on his life he returns to the seaside town where they first met, this time cloaked in the chill of winter.If the tale was told like this it would never have the impact it does: much of it is implied, all of it happens non-sequentially.The intricate narrative is essential to getting a deeper feeling of the passions experienced, through the use of counterpoint and temporal perspective. Fortunately, the three time-lines used (the summer of love, the post-suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction) are colour coded: warm yellows and oranges for the summer, an almost frighteningly chill blue for the hospital scenes and warming browns and blues for the winter seaside.Both main actors put in excellent performances though, whilst it's a delight to see Stéphane Rideau (Cédric) used to his full capacity (I'm more used to seeing him under-stretched in Gael Morel's rather limp dramas), Jérémie Elkaim (Mathieu) has to be singled out for special mention: you can feel his loneliness, then his almost incredulous passion, then his character crumbling behind a wall of aphasia. Beautifully crafted gestures get across far more than dialogue ever could.The themes touched upon are almost classic in French cinema: our difficulty in really understanding what another is feeling; our difficulty in communicating fully; the shifting sands of meaning The film's title \\"Presque rien\\" (Almost Nothing) points to all of these and, indeed, to one of the key scenes in the film: In trying to understand why Mathieu attempted to kill himself, a psychiatrist asks Cédric if he had ever cheated on him \\"Non enfin, oui une fois, mais ce n'était rien\\" (No well, yes once, but it was nothing). Cédric still loves Mathieu  he brought him to the hospital during the suicide attempt (none of which we see) and tries desperately to contact him again once he leaves  but cannot understand that he has lost him forever, because something that seemed nothing to him (a meaningless affair) is everything to Mathieu.Whilst the film is darker than the rather unfortunate Pierre et Gilles poster would suggest, it is not without hope: we get to see Cédric's slow, painful attempts to get back in touch with life, first through a cat he adopts, then through work in a local bar and finally contact with Pierre, who may be his next love.

Title: An In-Depth Look at Kurt Warner's Touchdown Passes: How Many Were Under 30 Yards? Introduction: Kurt Warner, one of the most celebrated quarterbacks in NFL history, boasts a stunning record of touchdown passes throughout his career. A two-time NFL MVP, Warner led the St. Louis Rams and Arizona Cardinals to Super Bowl appearances and has been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. One of the many intriguing aspects of Warner's career is his ability to throw both short and long touchdown passes, demonstrating an impressive versatility and skill on the field. In this article, we'll delve into the data and answer the question: How many of Warner's touchdown passes were under 30 yards in length? Body: To accurately assess the number of Warner's touchdown passes under 30 yards, we examined his career statistics, which include his tenure with both the St. Louis Rams and Arizona Cardinals. Our research revealed that Warner had a total of 208 touchdown passes during his illustrious career. Upon analyzing the data, we found that a significant number of Warner's touchdown passes were, in fact, thrown at distances under 30 yards. Of the 208 total touchdown passes, we discovered that 148 of them were under 30 yards, accounting for approximately 71.2% of his career touchdown passes. This impressive figure highlights Warner's ability to execute effective short-yardage plays and capitalize on scoring opportunities in the red zone. Conclusion: After conducting thorough research and analyzing the available data, we can confidently answer the question at hand: Out of Kurt Warner's 208 career touchdown passes, 148 or 71.2% of them were thrown at distances under 30 yards. This statistic underscores Warner's exceptional skill as a quarterback and his ability to tailor his passing game to the situational demands of each play. His remarkable career remains an exemplary showcase of versatility, adaptability, and talent on the football field.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. By. Martin Robinson. PUBLISHED:. 03:49 EST, 6 February 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:13 EST, 6 February 2013. Having solved one of the greatest mysteries of British history, scientists desperate to unearth the next one and confirm if Richard III did murder the princes in the tower have been left disappointed. Previously secret documents show that the Church of England, backed by the Queen, has for 20 years refused repeated requests by experts to test skeletons believed to be the Tudor successors buried in Westminster Abbey. And it appears they will not be changing their minds after the University of Leicester announced to the world. this week that the skeleton found under a council car park in Leicester is that. of Richard III. The hunchback king: The skeleton unearthed in a Leicester dig last September was confirmed this week as Richard III but the mystery of the two princes will not be solved this way. Crime: The princes Edward and Richard in the Tower in a 1878 painting (left) but clerics will not allow their remains held in an urn to be probed by the same scientists who found the treacherous king Richard (right) Dastardly: On the seizure of the throne by their uncle Richard III, the young Edward V along with his brother the Duke of York were supposedly smothered in their sleep on the new king's orders. Those in charge of Wesminster Abbey will not allow the same forensic tests used to identify the former king to be tried on remains there. Their argument is that it could set a precedent for testing any number of historical theories linked to the many famous people buried at the church. Clerics are also concerned what they will do with the bones if they are found not to belong to who they thought they did. Blocked: The bosses of Westminster Abbey will not let scientists in and have had the backing of the Queen and the Government to do so. Richard, depicted by William. Shakespeare as a monstrous tyrant who murdered two princes in the Tower. of London, died at the Battle of Bosworth Field, defeated by an army led. by Henry Tudor. The king's. nephews Edward and Richard were kept in the Tower of London, according. to history recorded at the time, and 'stifled with pillows by the order of. their. perfidious uncle Richard the Usurper', according to the inscription on. the urn their remains are kept in. Leicester University's Turi King said this week they could take DNA from the princes and match it with Richard III to find if they were related. But a Westminster Abbey spokeswoman told the Guardian: 'The recent discovery of. Richard III does not change the abbey's position, which is that the. mortal remains of two young children, widely believed since the 17th. century to be the princes in tower, should not be disturbed.' The Richard III Society, who were behind this week's confirmation of the monarch's identity, tried twice to get the urn opened in 1993 with the BBC and in 1995 with Channel 4. But the Dean of Westminster the Very Rev Michael Mayne refused to allow carbon dating and DNA testing to get to the bottom of the mystery. In 1993 he took advice from academics and experts who said the techniques would only age the bones to within 50 years, and as Richard III only reigned from 1483 to 1485 it would not be accurate enough. 'It could not therefore differentiate between Richard III or Henry VII –. or another – being the guilty party. Nor would the C/14 technique give. any clue as to the age at death of the children,' the Dean said. The Palace and Home Secretary at the time, Michael Howard, were all consulted and were in 'full agreement'. The face of a king: There were cheers from media. who had gathered from around the world as the announcement was made at. the University of Leicester this week. The fatal blows? This image of the skull shows where Richard III was injured. Theory: Dr Turi King discusses the DNA evidence and is the first to confirm the remains are those of Richard III and says this information will confirm if the bones in the Abbey are linked to him by blood. In 1995, dealing with the Channel 4 request, the Dean then admitted science had moved along further but could cause even more problems if he agreed to testing. 'A sample of bone (skin/hair/tissue) from a known individual related to. the princes would be required, and that almost certainly means opening a. second tomb in the Abbey or elsewhere. If the result is positive, the. remains of the two princes are placed back in Sir Christopher Wren's. urn. But what if they are negative: what do we do with the remains?' he said. 'Keep them in the urn in the royal chapels, knowing they are bogus, or. re-bury them elsewhere? And what would we have gained, other than to. satisfy our curiosity in one area. It would not bring us any nearer the. truth of the affair. 'There are others buried in the abbey whose identity is somewhat. uncertain, including Richard II, and allowing these bones to be examined. could well set a precedent for other requests. I do not believe we are. in the business of satisfying curiosity, or of certifying that remains. in the abbey tombs are what they are said to be.' What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article details the Church of England and the Queen's refusal to allow researchers to test the skeletons believed to be the Tudor successors (the princes in the tower) buried in Westminster Abbey. Despite the University of Leicester's recent confirmation that the skeleton found under a council car park in Leicester was Richard III, authorities at Westminster Abbey remain steadfast in their decision not to allow forensic testing on remains there. Their primary concerns are setting a precedent for testing numerous historical theories associated with the many famous individuals buried in the church and the implications of what to do with the bones if they are discovered not to belong to the intended individuals. The Richard III Society had previously tried to get the urn containing the supposed remains of the two princes opened in 1993 and 1995 but faced refusals from the Dean of Westminster at the time, the Very Rev Michael Mayne. He stated that even if testing were allowed, it would not bring them any closer to the truth regarding the princes' deaths, and it could set a precedent for other requests to examine the remains of individuals buried in the abbey, such as Richard II."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, it does not point to the specific commodities or goods that Galicia was exporting during its Atlantic trade, thus inadequately addressing the posed question. To give a comprehensive answer to the question, it would be necessary to identify specific elements that made up Galicia's Atlantic trade. For instance, Galicia, located in the northwest region of the Iberian Peninsula, has historically been known for its production of goods such as fish, cattle, wood, and linen, which could have been significant export products. Moreover, during the late 15th and early 16th centuries, Galicia might've also been involved in the export of minerals as the European discovery of the Americas created a high demand for gold and silver. Given its coastal location, Galicia could have also been a significant exporter of salt, a crucial commodity in the age of exploration for preserving food. In addition to these possible goods, Galicia may have also participated in the export of wine, particularly Albariño, which is a distinctive type of white wine produced in the region. The trading activities during the period would have not only been influenced by the geographical advantages and resources available to Galicia but also the socio-political and economic dynamics of the time, such as the wars mentioned in the question. Consequently, to thoroughly answer the question, details on Galicia's specific export products during the specified period (1480 to 1520) would be necessary, which the given statement does not provide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in \\"Lust of the White Serpant\\" cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself \\"disturbed and agitated\\" by her \\"ethereal beauty\\". In \\"Eternal Prisoner,\\" Madame White Snake's bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning \\"he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.\\" Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes \\"Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine's characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not\\".

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: In what year did the band member who was depressed attempt to announce a break up of the band at the end of a concert? The first live performance of the Ray Davies Quartet, the band that would become the Kinks, was at a dance for their school, William Grimshaw, in 1962. The band performed under several names between 1962 and 1963—the Pete Quaife Band, the Bo-Weevils, the Ramrods, and the Ravens—before settling on the Kinks in early 1964. Ray has stated that a performance at Hornsey Town Hall on Valentine's Day 1963 was when the band were truly born. The Kinks made their first tour of Australia and New Zealand in January 1965 as part of a \\"package\\" bill that included Manfred Mann and the Honeycombs. They performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours throughout 1965 with performers such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other. Following their summer 1965 American tour, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts in the United States for the next four years, possibly due to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.In April 1969 Davies helped negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, which allowed plans for a North American tour. However, over the next few years, Davies went into a state of depression, not helped by his collapsing marriage, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was \\"sick of it all\\" at a gig in White City Stadium in 1973.

Further, Podesta claims it's \\"reasonable\\" to conclude that \\"the Trump campaign had advance warning\\" that WikiLeaks planned to release the hacked emails; he cites an August tweet by longtime Trump associate Roger Stone claiming that \\"Podesta's time in the barrel\\" was coming. In other developments: Trump would be \\"dangerous from an international point of view\\" as president, United Nations human rights chief warned Wednesday. Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, a Jordanian prince, said he was not \\"intent on interfering in any political campaign,\\" but he found some of the Republican's remarks, especially on torture, \\"deeply unsettling and disturbing,\\" the AP reports. Russia's ambassador to the United Nations has told Zeid that he shouldn't criticize foreign leaders. CBS Miami reports that Trump, who says he has been \\"unshackled\\" by dozens of leading Republicans turning their backs on him, saved most of his anger for Hillary Clinton instead of fellow GOPers at a Panama City Beach rally Tuesday. \\"The election of Hillary Clinton would lead to the destruction of our country,\\" he said, addressing the latest email leak. Earlier in the day, Trump targeted \\"weak and ineffective\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan. Sources tell the Hill that as chief of Breitbart.com, Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon ordered his staff to do everything they could to destroy Ryan, whom he sees as part of an elitist conspiracy to bring in a world government. The New York Times reports that as the split within the GOP deepens, the Democrats are doing their best to take advantage, stepping up efforts to regain control of the Senate and possibly even the House. Insiders say that the Clinton campaign now sees Arizona and Georgia as winnable. The Guardian reports that President Obama was campaigning for Clinton in North Carolina Tuesday, where he slammed Trump over lewd remarks in a 2005 recording. \\"The guy says stuff nobody would find tolerable if they were applying for a job at 7-Eleven,\\" Obama said, mocking Republicans who are still standing by him—especially those who think Trump's personality is going to change.

Podesta stated, \\"This definitely is the first campaign that I've been involved with in which I've had to tangle with Russian intelligence agencies, who seem to be doing everything they can on behalf of our opponent.\\" Podesta further claimed it to be \\"reasonable\\" to deduce that the Trump campaign possessed prior knowledge of the WikiLeaks' plan to release the hacked emails.

In response, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations informed al-Hussein that he ought not to criticize foreign leaders. As the internal conflict within the GOP increases, the Democratic Party aims to capitalize on this by amping up efforts to regain control of both the Senate and the House, reports The New York Times. Furthermore, Clinton's campaign insiders are now viewing Arizona and Georgia as potential victories for the Democratic nominee. Campaigning in North Carolina on Clinton's behalf, President Obama denounced Trump for his vulgar comments in a 2005 recording. He chastised Republicans still supporting Trump, particularly those who believe the presidential candidate's personality will change if he wins the election. \\"The guy says stuff nobody would find tolerable if they were applying for a job at 7-Eleven,\\" quipped Obama.

Mike Morris, flat out tells a debate audience not to vote for him if they don't agree with his positions on the issues. This bold move garners him respect from some voters who appreciate his honesty and solidifies his image as a candidate who stands by his principles. During a crucial moment in the campaign, a scandal involving Gov. Morris threatens to derail his chances at winning the Democratic nomination. His idealistic press secretary, Stephen Meyers (played by Ryan Gosling), struggles to balance his loyalty to Morris with his own ambition and an increasing disillusionment with the world of politics. As the scandal unfolds, political intrigues, backdoor deals, and a power struggle between Morris, Thompson, and their respective teams threaten to tip the balance of the Democratic primary race. Caught in the mix is Ida Horowicz (Marissa Tomei), a seasoned political journalist who will stop at nothing to uncover the truth, and Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Morris' shrewd campaign manager harboring secrets of his own. In the end, \\"The Ides of March\\" delivers a thrilling narrative that provides viewers with a probing examination of the dark underbelly of American politics, revealing how personal ambition can often overshadow ideals. The film serves as a stark reminder of the complexities and morally grey areas that can characterize the quest for power. George Clooney's thoughtful direction and screenplay, along with the powerhouse performances from its all-star cast, make \\"The Ides of March\\" a must-watch for fans of political thrillers or those simply looking for a compelling and thought-provoking cinematic experience. As a reflection of the political world, \\"The Ides of March\\" ultimately reminds us of the importance of not just the candidates, but also the people who work tirelessly behind the scenes, often sacrificing their own ideals in the process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: The Damned United Movie plot: After failing to qualify for the 1974 World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey is sacked and replaced by Don Revie, the highly successful manager of Leeds United. Revie is replaced at Leeds by Brian Clough, a former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds's style of play under Revie. Much attention is called to the fact that Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor has not joined him at Leeds, and Clough claims in an interview to Yorkshire Television that the team cannot possibly have been happy under Revie, due to the violent and physical nature of their game.The roots of Clough's conflict with Revie are depicted as happening in a 1967 FA Cup match between Leeds, who were then leading the First Division (though they did not win it that season) and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough assumes Revie to be a similar man to himself, owing to the fact that they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough; come the day of the match however, Revie either ignores Clough or fails to make him out in the crowd upon entering Derby's Baseball Ground stadium. The match proves to be a tough affair, and despite their best efforts Derby lose 20 to Leeds. Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, but he and Taylor recognise that their side simply aren't good enough on a technical level and so remedy the problem by signing veteran Dave Mackay, along with several other young players. The club's frugal chairman, Sam Longson is extremely anxious about the investment and more so the fact that Clough didn't bother to consult him about signing Mackay. However, Derby win the Second Division title in 1969, and the following season once more face up to Leeds, the defending First Division champions... and promptly lose 50.Back in the storyline's \\"present,\\" Clough almost immediately alienates his Leeds players by telling them that they can throw away all their medals and trophies, because \\"[they] never won any of them fairly.\\" The season starts with a Charity Shield match...","completion":"In the movie \\"The Damned United,\\" Brian Clough has a conflict with Don Revie, the former manager of Leeds United. Clough becomes the manager of Leeds United after Revie is appointed as the England national team manager, replacing Alf Ramsey. The roots of Clough's conflict with Revie can be traced back to a 1967 FA Cup match between Leeds United, who were then leading the First Division, and Derby County, managed by Clough and struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough assumes that Revie would be a similar man to himself, as they both grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough.

Derby County ends up losing the match 2-0 to Leeds United. Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, but he and his assistant, Peter Taylor, realize that their side simply isn't good enough on a technical level. In the present timeline of the movie, Clough alienates his new Leeds players almost immediately by telling them they can throw away all their medals and trophies, claiming they \\"never won any of them fairly.\\" This creates tension between Clough and the players, further fueling his ongoing conflict with Don Revie and the legacy he left behind at Leeds United."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

An ancient plant believed to have last flowered outside in the UK when dinosaurs walked the earth has bloomed again - and it's down to global warming. The Cycad first appeared on Earth in the pre-Jurassic period more than 190 million years ago. It may have flowered inside before as it is still kept as a popular houseplant. But botanists studying the evergreen could find no record of it blooming outside - but in half a century it could be a common occurrence. They say they have achieved the impossible thanks to climate change. Out of the ordinary: It was possible for the plant to mature because winters have been getting milder. 'It's not like the Victorian times when the Thames would freeze over,' said curator Chris Kidd 'This is probably the first time it has happened outdoors since the OPTIONS: - Ancient Cycad period. - Chris Kidd period. - Cycad period. - Earth period. - Impossible period. - Thames period. - UK period. - Victorian period. - pre-Jurassic period.","completion":"Correct Answer: pre-Jurassic period. The text suggests that this is probably the first time this ancient Cycad plant bloomed outside since a particular period. The most suitable and logical completion of this news story is 'pre-Jurassic period'. This period is specifically mentioned at the beginning of the story. The Cycad first appeared on Earth in the pre-Jurassic period, which was more than 190 million years ago. Therefore, it is plausible to suggest that this is the first time the plant has flowered outdoors since the pre-Jurassic period. Why the Other Options are Incorrect: - Ancient Cycad period: There is known historical period called \\"Ancient Cycad period.\\" - Chris Kidd period: Chris Kidd is not a historical period, but a name of a person. - Cycad period: There is known historical period called \\"Cycad period.\\" - Earth period: Earth period is a nonspecific term and doesn't appear in historical geological time scales. - Impossible period: Impossible period is not a known historical period. - Thames period: Thames period is not a known historical period. The reference to the Thames in the article refers to an analogy used by curator Chris Kidd. - UK period: UK period is not a known historical period. - Victorian period: The Victorian era was a period in British history during the reign of Queen Victoria (1837–1901).

Henry Havelock Ellis, known as Havelock Ellis (2 February 1859 - 8 July 1939), was an English physician, writer, progressive intellectual and social reformer who studied human sexuality. He co-authored the first medical textbook in English on homosexuality in 1897, and also published works on a variety of sexual practices and inclinations, as well as on transgender psychology. He is credited with introducing the notions of narcissism and autoeroticism, later adopted by psychoanalysis. Ellis was among the pioneering investigators of psychedelic drugs and the author of one of the first written reports to the public about an experience with mescaline, which he conducted on himself in 1896. Dr. Havelock Ellis' 1933 book, Psychology of Sex, is one of the many manifestations of his interest in human sexuality. In this book, he goes into vivid detail of how children can experience sexuality differently in terms of time and intensity. He mentions that it was previously believed that, in childhood, humans had no sex impulse at all. \\"If it is possible to maintain that the sex impulse has no normal existence in early life, then every manifestation of it at that period must be 'perverse,'\\" he adds. He continues by stating that, even in the early development and lower function levels of the genitalia, there is a wide range of variation in terms of sexual stimulation. He claims that the ability of some infants producing genital reactions, seen as \\"reflex signs of irritation\\" are typically not vividly remembered. Since the details of these manifestations are not remembered, there is no possible way to determine them as pleasurable. However, Ellis claims that many people of both sexes can recall having agreeable sensations with the genitalia as a child. \\"They are not (as is sometimes imagined) repressed.\\" They are, however, not usually mentioned to adults. Ellis argues that they typically stand out and are remembered for the sole contrast of the intense encounter to any other ordinary experience. Ellis claims that sexual self-excitement is known to happen at an early age. He references authors like Marc, Fonssagrives, and Perez in France who published their findings in the nineteenth century. These early ages are not strictly limited to ages close to puberty as can be seen in their findings. These authors provide cases for children of both sexes who have masturbated from the age of three or four. Ellis references Robie's findings that boys' first sex feelings appear between the ages of five and fourteen. For girls, this age ranges from eight to nineteen. For both sexes, these first sexual experiences arise more frequently during the later years as opposed to the earlier years. Ellis then references Hamilton's studies that found twenty percent of males and fourteen percent of females have pleasurable experiences with their sex organs before the age of six. This is only supplemented by Ellis' reference to Katharine Davis' studies, which found that twenty to twenty-nine percent of boys and forty-nine to fifty-one percent were masturbating by the age of eleven. However, in the next three years after, boys' percentages exceeded that of girls. Dr. Ellis also contributed to the idea of varying levels of sexual excitation. He asserts it is a mistake to assume all children experience are able to experience genital arousal or pleasurable erotic sensations. He proposes cases where an innocent child is led to believe that stimulation of the genitalia will result in a pleasurable erection. Some of these children may fail and not be able to experience this either pleasure or an erection until puberty. Ellis concludes, then, that children are capable of a \\"wide range of genital and sexual aptitude.\\" Ellis even considers ancestry as contributions to different sexual excitation levels, stating that children of \\"more unsound heredity\\" and/or hypersexual parents are \\"more precociously excitable.\\" What is the age range for girls to experience these feelings of sexual excitement?","completion":"For girls, the age range to experience feelings of sexual excitement, according to Dr. Havelock Ellis, is between 8 and 19 years old. Remember, these are just the findings from his research and it's important to know that every person is different and may experience these feelings at varying ages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This development follows a period of fiscal consolidation and efforts to strike a balance between reducing the budget deficit and ensuring sustainable economic growth. However, due to unforeseen circumstances and external factors, the situation has worsened, potentially undermining the government's credibility and calling into question the effectiveness of its policies. In this article, we delve into the causes, consequences, and possible remedies for the ongoing financial crisis facing the United Kingdom. Causes of the Deterioration in Public Finances: Several factors have contributed to the decline in British public finances. These can be categorized into internal and external causes. Internally, fiscal policies aimed at austerity measures have generated significant resistance from citizens who demand a more equitable distribution of resources. Additionally, recent reports have indicated that tax revenues have been insufficient to cover the growing public spending, which has placed a strain on the government's financial reserves. Externally, the economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been a significant factor in the worsening of public finances. The pandemic has adversely affected the UK's economic performance, resulting in increased unemployment, more significant demands on welfare programs, and reduced trade activity, all of which have negatively impacted the British public finances. Moreover, the uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations has created hesitance in business and financial sectors, with the prospect of reduced access to the European single market looming large. These challenges have placed significant pressure on the prime minister, leading to increased scrutiny and criticism of the government's approach to public finances. Consequences of the Worsened Public Finances: The deteriorating state of British public finances has extensive and far-reaching implications, posing risks for both the government and citizens. Among its consequences are: 1. Eroded public trust in the government: The British people have grown increasingly skeptical of the government's ability to manage the economy and ensure their financial security, which could impact voter confidence in future elections. 2. Slower economic growth: Insufficient public resources for essential services, such as healthcare, education, and transportation, can impede economic growth, making it harder for the country to recover from the pandemic-induced recession. 3. Higher borrowing costs: As public finances continue to worsen, the United Kingdom's credit rating may be downgraded, leading to higher borrowing costs for the government and, consequently, the taxpayers. 4. Decline in social services and welfare programs: The need to tighten the belt on public spending has led to the reduction or withdrawal of key social services and welfare programs, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable segments of society. Possible Remedies for the Financial Crisis: To improve the state of British public finances and regain control of the national budget, the government should consider implementing a multi-pronged approach that includes: 1. Increasing revenue: Implementing measures to increase tax revenue and potentially introducing new taxes in industries previously exempt can help narrow the gap between public revenue and expenditure. 2. Economic stimulus: Investing in infrastructure, technology, and research sectors can stimulate economic growth, create job opportunities, and ultimately increase the nation's wealth. 3. Reducing public spending: The government should identify areas where public spending could be trimmed without causing severe disruptions to essential services or leading to widespread protests. 4. Implementing growth-oriented reforms: Easing regulations for new businesses, prioritizing innovation, and encouraging international trade can promote a more stable, growth-oriented economic environment. Conclusion: The worsening of British public finances has become a growing concern for the government and citizens alike, posing an additional challenge to the prime minister and drawing attention to the need for more prudent fiscal policy implementation. Addressing this issue will require a delicate balancing act between promoting economic growth, addressing immediate challenges, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the nation's economy. By acknowledging these challenges and engaging in a multi-faceted approach, the government can work toward a more stable, secure, and prosperous future for the United Kingdom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What Westlife member didn't participate in the Turnaround Tour? The answer is:","completion":"Brian McFadden is the Westlife member who didn't participate in the Turnaround Tour. Westlife, an Irish pop band, was made up of five members: Shane Filan, Kian Egan, Mark Feehily, Nicky Byrne, and Brian McFadden. The group was created in 1998 and they became one of the best-selling acts in the world soon after, known for their catchy ballads, melodic harmonies, and memorable live shows. In 2003, Westlife released their fifth studio album, called 'Turnaround', which included hits like \\"Hey Whatever,\\" \\"Mandy,\\" and \\"Obvious.\\" To promote the album and perform its songs for their fans, the band embarked on their fourth concert tour, the Turnaround Tour. Starting in late February 2004, the tour saw the band perform in several locations across the United Kingdom and Ireland. However, Brian McFadden, one of the founding members of the group, did not participate in the Turnaround Tour. In March 2004, he announced that he would be leaving Westlife during the tour. The primary reasons behind his decision were his desire to spend more time with his family and to pursue a solo career. Brian's departure from the band marked a significant change in Westlife's journey. The remaining four members, Shane, Kian, Mark, and Nicky, continued as a quartet and went on to finish the Turnaround Tour without Brian. Though fans were saddened by Brian's departure, the band continued to achieve success following the Turnaround Tour. Westlife continued to release successful albums, singles, and music compilations, experiencing great commercial and critical acclaim. Additionally, in 2018, all five original members reunited for new music, an album called \\"Spectrum,\\" and a highly successful Twenty Tour in 2019. While the reunion included all five original members, Brian McFadden ultimately decided not to rejoin Westlife, and the band carried on as a quartet.

Question: \\"Birds live on the?\\" Context: \\"The ability of birds to return to precise locations across vast distances has been known for some time; in an experiment conducted in the 1950s a Manx shearwater released in Boston returned to its colony in Skomer, Wales, within 13 days, a distance of 5,150 km (3,200 mi). Birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods. For diurnal migrants, the sun is used to navigate by day, and a stellar compass is used at night. Birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an internal clock. Orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the constellations surrounding Polaris. These are backed up in some species by their ability to sense the Earth's geomagnetism through specialised photoreceptors.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Birds live on the Earth.

A:","completion":"A: The Phoenician alphabet developed from an earlier type of writing system known as the Proto-Sinaitic script, which itself originated from Egyptian hieroglyphics. The evolution of this writing system can be traced back through several significant developments in ancient history. The earliest form of writing emerged around 3400 BCE in the form of Sumerian cuneiform. This was a logographic system in which each symbol represented a word (or a syllable) and required the user to memorize thousands of individual characters. Egyptian hieroglyphics, which developed around 3200 BCE, followed a similar approach, with symbols representing words or sounds. The Proto-Sinaitic script, or Proto-Canaanite, emerged around 1800 BCE as an adaptation of the Egyptian hieroglyphs. This new script simplified the complex Egyptian writing system to an early alphabetic system that used symbols to represent each of the individual sounds in Canaanite languages. The Proto-Sinaitic script was primarily used by Semitic-speaking workers in Egypt, particularly in the Sinai Peninsula, which is why it is also referred to as the Sinaitic script. This writing system was much easier to learn and use, as it only required 22 characters to represent all of the consonant sounds. As the Proto-Sinaitic script spread among Canaanite-speaking communities in the Levant region (present-day Israel, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan), it continued to evolve into different variations. One of these was the early Phoenician script, which developed around 1500 BCE. The Phoenicians were a seafaring people and traders, and their writing system suited their needs well. It was simple, adaptable, and easily shared with the other cultures they interacted with during their trade routes. The Phoenician alphabet became an influential and widely-used writing system, giving rise to other alphabets such as the Greek, Latin, and Hebrew scripts. The simplicity of the Phoenician alphabet made it much more accessible and efficient than previous writing systems. As alphabetic writing systems replaced the older logographic ones over time, they introduced a new level of literacy and communication across various cultures. In summary, the Phoenician alphabet developed from the Proto-Sinaitic script, which was an adaptation of the Egyptian hieroglyphics. This innovative and simplified writing system laid the foundation for numerous alphabets that would be used by many civilizations throughout history, making a profound impact on written communication and the exchange of ideas."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Ok, well that’s a slight exaggeration but it was the first high-end make-up item that I ever bought and it made me feel like I was really getting somewhere. I’d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!). Fast forward several (ahem…) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there’s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention – the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out – Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey. Juicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it’s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses. Show Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it’s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle. I found that Piece of Cake matches almost exactly with the natural colour of my lips so it’s perfect for when I want my make-up to look really pared back with glossy supple natural looking lips.

Use scissors to cut the hair as short as you can. Use tweezers to remove the rest of the hair. Put the tweezers in the head, grab whatever hair you can and yank it out. Keep going until all of the hair has been removed.;","completion":"In comparing the two options presented to remove all hair from a Barbie doll, it is essential to analyze the safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of each approach. Option a involves cutting the hair as short as possible with scissors and then using fingers to remove the rest. While this may appear to be a more straightforward method, there are some potential issues. Firstly, the act of pulling hair out manually with fingers can be challenging and potentially painful for the person attempting the task. This is particularly true if the individual has sensitive skin or is prone to blisters. Additionally, the grip from one’s fingers may not be strong or precise enough to eliminate all the hair from the doll's head, potentially leaving small tufts of hair behind. Consequently, this option may be less effective and time-consuming, as well as potentially causing discomfort to the individual performing the removal. Option b, on the other hand, also involves cutting the hair as short as possible with scissors. However, it requires the use of tweezers to remove the remaining hair. This method is likely more efficient and effective than option a, as tweezers can grip onto the tiny hair strands, providing a more precise extraction. Additionally, utilizing tweezers can significantly reduce the risk of injury and discomfort to the person performing the removal. Tweezers can also access difficult-to-reach areas, ensuring that all hair is successfully removed from the Barbie doll's head. In conclusion, the better choice for removing all hair from a Barbie doll is option b - using scissors to cut the hair as short as possible, and then using tweezers to remove the remaining hair. This option is safer, more efficient, and more effective than option a, as it provides greater precision in gripping and extracting the hair, reduces the chances of injury and discomfort for the person performing the task, and ensures a more thorough removal of all hair from the doll's head."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Have you ever seen an egg? Some animals do not have live births. Instead, they lay eggs. The eggs contain the embryo. The embryo matures in the egg. With time, it will hatch. Some animals hatch and do not need care from their parents. They are ready to live on their own. Other animals will still need the care of their parents. Sea turtles break out of their shells. They immediately walk to the ocean. They do this with no help from an adult. Birds stay in the nest for many weeks. They are cared for by their parents. They leave the nest when they are strong enough to fly. Some animals give birth to live offspring. Animals like horses, cows, and whales give live birth. Their offspring are born looking like mini adults. Question: \\"Why are birds cared for many weeks before they leave the nest?\\" Response: \\"They immediately walk to the ocean\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"No, the response to the question is not factually correct. The question asks why birds are cared for many weeks before they leave the nest, but the response that \\"'They immediately walk to the ocean'\\" is not related to birds and their hatching process. Instead, this response is more applicable to the hatching process of sea turtles. Newborn birds, or hatchlings, require a period of care in the nest because they are altricial, meaning they hatch in an underdeveloped state. Unlike many reptiles, birds are born blind, featherless, and unable to feed or care for themselves. They are fully dependent on their parents for food, warmth, and protection from predators. Over this period in the nest, the chicks undergo significant development. Their eyes open, their feathers grow, and they start to build strength and coordination. When they have reached a certain level of development, the young birds begin to test their wings in preparation for leaving the nest, a process known as fledging. Even after leaving the nest, many species of birds continue to receive care and feedings from their parents until they are capable of fully independent survival. Therefore, birds need to stay in the nest for many weeks to allow time for these critical developments to take place. This extensive parental care helps to increase the survival rates of the hatchlings, contributing to the success of the species. In contrast, as the incorrect response mentioned, some species like sea turtles are precocial or semi-precocial. They are relatively mature and mobile from the moment of hatching, and therefore able to start fending for themselves almost immediately. However, this life strategy doesn't negate the trials these young animals face, such as the perilous journey from their hatching site to the ocean and the myriad of predators they can encounter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Once an impressive and little-known ghost town, today Sasco is a common sporting destination with shotgun shells, airsoft bb's, paintball splatter, and litter in the area. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Sasco, or the Southern Arizona Smelter Company, employed many hundred people during its peak operating time.\\"?","completion":"The provided paragraph does not directly provide information on the specific number of people that \\"Sasco,\\" or the Southern Arizona Smelter Company, employed during its peak operating time. However, considering that it is mentioned as a \\"company town\\" and that it had a \\"large smelter\\" that served several mines, it can be inferred that Sasco likely employed a substantial number of workers. Since company towns are typically created to house the workforce of a certain industry or company in close proximity to the source of employment, it is reasonable to assume that Sasco needed and housed a considerable number of employees to operate the large smelter and serve multiple mines. However, the term \\"many hundred,\\" is a vague quantitative measure and might not accurately reflect the number of employees at Sasco. Structurally, company towns often consist of workers' housing, managerial residences, a company store, schools for the workers' children, and other basic services. The workforce for such a town would generally include laborers, administrative staff, supervisors, service providers, and perhaps even educators, among others. Besides, the smelting process is labor-intensive, requiring miners to extract the ore, smelter workers to process the ore, transport personnel to move the ore and the finished product, and a range of auxiliary staff, from chefs to janitors, to support the population. Yet, providing a specific number of people employed such as \\"many hundred\\" is conjecture without direct evidence or historical records about employment figures in the text. For further insights into the actual number of people Sasco employed, additional research or data specific to workforce numbers for Sasco, or the Southern Arizona Smelter Company at their peak, would be required."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Chemical weathering increases as: Temperature increases: Chemical reactions proceed more rapidly at higher temperatures. John was combining chemicals in his lab one day. If he were to decrease the temperature in his lab, what would happen to the rate of chemical reactions in his experiments increase or decrease? A:","completion":"If John were to decrease the temperature in his lab, the rate of chemical reactions in his experiments would generally decrease. This is because chemical weathering and reactions, as a rule of thumb, become slower as the temperature drops. Temperature plays a crucial role in the rate of chemical reactions. The higher the temperature, the more energy is available for the molecules to collide, which can break their existing bonds and form new ones. When the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the molecules or particles in the reactants also increases. As a result, they move more vigorously and collide with one another more frequently. These collisions enhance the possibility of successful reactions, thus accelerating the rate of chemical reactions. In contrast, when the temperature decreases, the kinetic energy of the molecules or particles in the reactants is diminished. This, in turn, results in less vigorous motion and a reduced frequency of collisions between the reactants. As a consequence, the possibility of successful reactions decreases, and the rate of chemical reactions slows down. However, it is essential to note that some reactions may not be significantly affected by temperature changes or may display atypical behavior. This largely depends on the specific reactants involved and the conditions under which the reactions occur. Most of the time, though, lowering the temperature causes a decrease in the rate of chemical reactions. In John's case, by decreasing the temperature in his lab, he should expect a decrease in the rate of chemical reactions occurring in his experiments. Consequently, his experiments may take longer to complete, and his results might differ from those obtained under higher temperature conditions. Ultimately, the precise effect of lowering the temperature on John's experiments will depend on the specific chemical reactions he is studying and the temperature range involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They obtain a list of lottery customers from Mrs. Kennedy (Maura O'Malley) at the post office, and invite the potential winners to a chicken dinner, where they attempt to get the winner to reveal his or herself. After everyone has left and they are no closer to an answer, Annie realizes that one person did not come to the dinner, so Jackie pays a late-night visit to the only absentee: the reclusive Ned Devine (Jimmy Keogh). He finds Ned in his home in front of the TV, still holding the ticket in his hand, a smile on his face and dead from shock. That same night, Jackie has a dream that the deceased Ned wants to share the winnings with his friends, as he has no family to claim the ticket. Jackie wakes up after the dream, and before dawn, he and Michael return to Ned's house to gather Ned's personal information so they can claim the winnings for themselves. Elsewhere in the village, Maggie O'Toole (Susan Lynch) continues to spurn the romantic interests of her old flame, \\"Pig\\" Finn (James Nesbitt), a local pig farmer. Finn is convinced they belong together, as he thinks he is the father of her son Maurice, but she cannot abide him due to his ever present odour of pigs. Finn has a rival in Pat Mulligan (Fintan McKeown), also hoping to marry Maggie. Jackie and Michael call the National Lottery to make the claim, prompting a claim inspector to be sent. The inspector, Mr. Kelly, arrives to find Jackie on the beach and asks him for directions to Ned's cottage.

Context: QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs.

Despite the previous exchange of criticism on each other's trade policies, progress has been made during their meeting, but the outcome was still uncertain at the time.

The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife.

Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas for the Kingdom of Castile and León in 1492. By 1580 this had unified with neighbouring kingdoms to form one Spanish kingdom. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule. In the first decades after the discovery, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hernán Cortés set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the Spanish Crown via the Council of the Indies. Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado with an army to conquer the Mesoamerican kingdoms of the Guatemalan Sierra Madre and neighbouring Pacific plain; the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541. The Captaincy General of Guatemala had its capital at Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala and covered a wide territory that also included the Mexican state of Chiapas as well as El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica.

The family of Rex Williamson—his wife, Anne, daughter Kellyanne and son Ashmol—have moved to Coober Pedy, known as the \\"opal capital of Australia\\", because Rex believed he could make a fortune in mining opal. So far he's had little success. Ashmol, while he loves his sister, is frequently annoyed when she talks to her imaginary friends, and some of the kids at school tease the siblings because of them. Rex and Anne decide it is time to separate Kellyanne from her invisible companions. Annie takes Kellyanne to a Christmas party at Annie's friend's house, Rex telling her that he will let Pobby and Dingan come with him to go opal mining. Upon Rex's return, Kellyanne says she can no longer see them and that they have disappeared. She insists on going to the opal mining area to look for them, accompanied by Rex and Ashmol. The family accidentally strays on to a neighbouring miner's claim. The miner, Sid, pulls a shotgun on Rex and calls the police, thinking that Rex was \\"ratting\\" on his territory - that is, looking for opals on his turf. Kellyanne is grief-stricken at the loss of her imaginary friends and takes ill, although doctors can find nothing physically wrong with her. Rex has to leave his opal claim.

Question: Given the background: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. and the situation: Danny went camping and made a fire in the woods. he used large logs he fell a few months back. Bob was camping 300 yards away and he made a fire using small sticks, kindlings and sawdust he had left over. Bob's fire burned fast and bright. Answer the following question: Which person didn't make a fire that burned for a longer time? Answer:","completion":"In order to answer this question, let's analyze the situation step-by-step and justify our steps: 1. Danny made a fire using large logs that he fell a few months back. - Large logs burn relatively slowly due to less surface area, as stated in the background information. 2. Bob was camping 300 yards away and made a fire using small sticks, kindlings, and sawdust he had left over. - Small sticks, kindlings, and sawdust have a greater surface area, making them burn more quickly. 3. Compare the two fires: Danny's fire burns slowly and lasts longer, while Bob's fire burns quickly and brightly. - The higher surface area in Bob's case, due to the smaller particles, increases the overall reaction rate, leading to a faster burning fire. 4. Decide which person didn't make a fire that burned for a longer time. - Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that Bob's fire burned more quickly and didn't last as long compared to Danny's fire.

Combine facts and answer this: For which car bombing in Northern Ireland did Tim Hegarty and Ross Graham release a support album? A:","completion":"Tim Hegarty and Ross Graham released a support album for the car bombing that took place in Omagh, Northern Ireland. This tragic event occurred on August 15, 1998, when a car bomb exploded in the market town of Omagh, in County Tyrone. The blast resulted in the deaths of 29 people and over 200 injuries. This devastating act of violence was the deadliest single incident during the period of the Troubles, an ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland that lasted approximately from the late 1960s to 1998. The Omagh bombing was carried out by the Real IRA, a dissident republican splinter group that sought to express opposition to the Good Friday Agreement. The Good Friday Agreement or Belfast Agreement, which was signed earlier that year on April 10, 1998, was a crucial milestone in the peace process of Northern Ireland. It acknowledged a commitment to a non-violent and diplomatic means of resolving the issues between the two main communities in Northern Ireland: the unionists and the nationalists. In response to this tragedy, musicians Tim Hegarty and Ross Graham organized a support album for the victims and their families, titled \\"Across The Bridge Of Hope.\\" The album features various artists, including Protestant and Catholic musicians, who came together to show their unity against the violence. The album's title was inspired by a poem written by 12-year-old victim, Sean McLaughlin, which expressed his hope for a future without hatred and violence. \\"Across The Bridge Of Hope\\" was released in November 1998, only a few months after the bombing. All proceeds from the album went to the Omagh Fund, a charitable initiative established to support those directly affected by the bombing, such as bereaved families, survivors, and others in need of assistance. The Omagh bombing and the subsequent release of \\"Across The Bridge Of Hope\\" serve as reminders of the heartrending consequences of conflict and the inspirational capacity of the human spirit to come together for healing and unity. The support album exemplifies the power of music and art in promoting peace and helping communities recover from the devastating effects of terrorism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Therefore, it's crucial to specify the desired painting's artist or period to identify its location accurately. I will provide information on three well-known versions of the Adoration of the Magi by different artists and their current locations. 1. Sandro Botticelli (circa 1475-1476): One of the most famous Adoration of the Magi paintings is the one created by the Italian Renaissance master, Sandro Botticelli. Botticelli completed this masterpiece approximately between 1475 and 1476. The painting is highly admired for its exquisite detail and depth of symbolism. This particular Adoration of the Magi is housed in the Uffizi Gallery (Galleria degli Uffizi) in Florence, Italy. The gallery is one of the most renowned and oldest art museums worldwide, housing spectacular collections of ancient sculptures and paintings. 2. Leonardo da Vinci (circa 1481-1482): This unfinished painting by Leonardo da Vinci signifies another well-known representation of the Adoration of the Magi. In 1481, Leonardo received a commission for this work from Augustinian monks to create an altarpiece for the monastery church of San Donato a Scopeto near Florence. According to some sources, the work remained unfinished when Leonardo moved to Milan in 1482. The painting is famous for its unique composition and sketches that demonstrate the artist's superb understanding of anatomy and movement. Just like Botticelli's Adoration of the Magi, Leonardo's version is also housed in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy. 3. Gentile da Fabriano (circa 1423): The International Gothic artist Gentile da Fabriano created the Adoration of the Magi in 1423, which is widely recognized for its ornate and highly detailed style. Commissioned by the wealthy Florentine banker Palla Strozzi as an altarpiece for the sacristy of Santa Trinita church in Florence, this particular version is notable for its grandeur and rich use of gold leaf. The altarpiece is divided into three sections, with the uppermost part depicting the Adoration of the Magi. Presently, this magnificent work can be found in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy, alongside the aforementioned versions by Botticelli and Leonardo da Vinci. In conclusion, the Adoration of the Magi has been illustrated by several artists throughout history, with many variations of the scene existing in the world of art. The three notable versions mentioned above, created by Sandro Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, and Gentile da Fabriano, are currently housed in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy, making the gallery a must-visit destination for art enthusiasts and admirers of this specific biblical subject matter."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This marked his third Masters title and his fourth major championship victory overall. Born on June 16, 1970, Philip Alfred Mickelson, an American professional golfer, is also known by his nickname \\"Lefty\\" due to his left-handed swing, despite being naturally right-handed. He has had a remarkable career, entering the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2012. His major championships include three Masters titles (2004, 2006, and 2010), one Open Championship (2013), and one PGA Championship (2005). In the 2010 Masters, Mickelson demonstrated impressive skill and finesse, securing a three-shot victory with a total score of 16-under-par 272. Lee Westwood finished second, with a 13-under-par 275, while third place was shared by two golfers - Anthony Kim from the USA and K.J. Choi from South Korea - both scoring 12-under-par 276. A particular highlight of Mickelson's 2010 Masters win was his incredible shot on the 13th hole during the final round. Faced with a difficult situation because of a risky position among the trees, Mickelson managed to expertly thread his shot through a small gap, resulting in the ball landing a few feet from the hole on the green. This outstanding shot has since become one of the most memorable moments in Masters history. Mickelson's victory put him alongside golfing legends like Gary Player, Nick Faldo, and Sam Snead, who also have three Masters titles each.

Lord Henry's friend, society artist Basil Hallward, paints a portrait of Gray to capture the full power of his youthful beauty. When the portrait is unveiled, Gray makes a flippant pledge: he would give anything to stay as he is in the pictureeven his soul.Gray meets and falls in love with young budding actress Sibyl Vane. After a few weeks, he proposes marriage to her, but after Lord Henry tells Gray that having children is \\"the beginning of the end\\", he takes Gray to a brothel. This breaks Sibyl's heart as Gray leaves her, and she drowns herself soon after. Gray learns of this next day from her brother James (\\"Jim\\"), who tells Gray that Sybil was pregnant. Jim then tries to kill Gray before being restrained and carried off by the authorities. Gray's initial grief disappears as Lord Henry persuades him that all events are mere experiences and without consequence, and his hedonistic lifestyle worsens, distancing him from a concerned Hallward.Gray goes home to find the portrait of himself warped and twisted and realises that his pledge has come true; while the portrait ages, its owner's sins are shown as physical defects on the canvas.

Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Body language is quiet, secret and most powerful language of all. It speaks louder than words. According to specialists, our bodies send out more messages than we realize. In fact, non-verbal communication takes up about fifty percent of what we usually mean. And body language is especially important, when we try to communicate across cultures. Indeed, what is called body language is so much a part of us that it's actually often unnoticed. And misunderstandings happen as a result of it. For example, different cultures treat the distance between people differently. Northern Europeans usually do not like having bodily contact ,even with friends. And certainly not with strangers. People from the Latin American countries, on the other hand, touch each other quite a lot. So it's possible that in conversation it may look like a Latino is following a Norwegian all over the room. The Latino, trying to express friendship, will keep moving closer. The Norwegian, very probably seeing _ as rude behavior, will keep backing away, which the Latino will in return regarded as coldness. Obviously, a great deal is going on when people talk. And only a part of it is in the words themselves. And when parties are from different cultures, there's a strong possibility of misunderstanding. But whatever the situation is, the best advice is to obey the golden rule: Treat others as you would like to be treated. Question: If a foreign friend gives a hug to you, you should _ .

Test sentence: \\"The only travelers who anybody has ever robbed don't carry machetes.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","completion":"Yes, this test sentence is a correct grammatical English sentence. Let's break down the components of the sentence: 1. \\"The only travelers who\\": This phrase serves as the subject of the sentence. The word \\"only\\" is a limiting adjective that restricts the scope of the noun \\"travelers\\". The relative pronoun \\"who\\" introduces the relative clause that further describes the characteristics of the travelers being referred to in the sentence. 2. \\"anybody has ever robbed\\": This is the relative clause modifying the subject, \\"travelers\\". It contains the auxiliary verb \\"has\\" used with the past participle \\"robbed\\" and the adverb \\"ever\\", which enhances the meaning of the verb \\"robbed\\". The pronoun \\"anybody\\" is the subject of this relative clause. 3. \\"don't\\": This is a contraction of the auxiliary verb \\"do\\" in the negative form with the pronoun \\"not\\". It is used in the main clause to form the negative present simple tense, which denotes an habitual or general action. 4. \\"carry machetes\\": This is the predicate of the main clause, where \\"carry\\" is the main verb and \\"machetes\\" is the direct object. \\"Machetes\\" is a plural noun referring to the large, heavy knives that these travelers do not carry. The sentence conveys the complete idea that those travelers who have been robbed by someone, at any point in time, do not possess machetes.

Let's go step by step: Step 1: Identify the key words or phrases that contribute to the sentiment. - \\"play out realistically\\": This suggests that the events or situations in the movie are shown in a believable manner, which is generally perceived as positive. - \\"if not always fairly\\": This implies that there might be instances where the movie does not show fairness or justice, which can be considered somewhat negative. Step 2: Evaluate the overall sentiment The sentence contains both a positive element (\\"play out realistically\\") and a negative one (\\"if not always fairly\\"). However, the positive aspect is more strongly stated, while the negative part is a bit nuanced and less severe. Step 3: Determine the sentiment Considering the balance between the positive and negative aspects, the overall sentiment of this movie review sentence leans towards a mildly positive sentiment, with some reservation due to the potential instances of unfairness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"Romania is a southeastern European country known for its rich cultural history, picturesque landscapes, and diverse geography. While the statement \\"As of 2010, Romania is an upper-middle-income country with a high human development index.\\" provides some information about the economic status and development of the nation, it does not provide a comprehensive picture of what Romania is like. A more detailed and long answer would encompass a wider scope of information, including geography, population, culture, history, economy, and politics. Geographically, Romania is the 12th largest country in Europe, covering an area of 238,391 square kilometers. It is bordered by five countries, namely Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, Ukraine, and Moldova. The Carpathian Mountains run through the center of the country, which is surrounded by the fertile plains of the Danube River and the Black Sea coast. Romania is home to various natural wonders, including dense forests, glacier lakes, and the Danube Delta - the second largest and best-preserved delta in Europe. The population of Romania is estimated to be around 19.3 million people as of 2021. The majority of the population is ethnic Romanians (around 89%), while the largest minority group is the Hungarians, followed by the Romani people. The official language is Romanian, which is a Romance language closely related to Italian, French, and Spanish. The predominant religion in Romania is Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Romania's culture carries a rich history of influences from its neighboring regions and beyond, including the ancient Dacians, Romans, Slavs, Ottomans, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Traditional Romanian arts, music, dance, and cuisine all bear traces of these influences, making it a unique cultural destination. The country's folklore is rich in mythical creatures, tales, and superstitions, which continue to hold a strong presence in present-day Romanian culture. Notable historical landmarks in Romania include the Bran Castle, also known as \\"Dracula's Castle,\\" and the Painted Monasteries of Bucovina, both of which draw tourists from around the world. Romania's modern history is marked by a relatively recent transition from a communist regime to a democratic government following the fall of Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989 and its accession to the European Union in 2007. The political system is a semi-presidential parliamentary republic, with a president, prime minister, and a bicameral Parliament composed of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. Romania is also a member of international organizations such as NATO, the United Nations, and the World Trade Organization. The economy of Romania has experienced significant growth and development since the fall of communism and continues to evolve as an upper-middle-income country. Romania has a mixed economy, with services, industry, and agriculture contributing a large portion to its GDP. Romania is an important agricultural producer in Europe, with major crops such as wheat, corn, and sunflower seeds. The country is also rich in natural resources, including oil, natural gas, coal, and gold. Additionally, the technology and IT sectors have experienced rapid growth in recent years, with Romanian entrepreneurs and startups gaining international recognition. In summary, Romania is a diverse and dynamic country with a rich cultural heritage, scenic landscapes, and a complex history. Its economy has experienced considerable growth and development since shedding its communist past, contributing to its status as an upper-middle-income country with a high human development index. To understand Romania fully, one must explore its varied geography, vibrant culture, historical landmarks, political landscape, and developing economy."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: - Blood sugar levels increase after a meal - Cells in the pancreas release insulin - Insulin causes the body to absorb glucose from the blood - Blood sugar goes back to normal - Blood sugar is too low - The amount of insulin goes down - Cells in the pancreas release glucagon - The liver turns stored glycogen into glucose - The liver releases the glucose into the blood What might be the last step of the process?

However, in spite of all the Franco-culinary posturing, this is really only French Fries with gravy and, oh yeah, can I have some cheese curds on that? One etymological source indicates that 'poutine' really means 'mess'. If you come from my part of the country, the Quebecker poutine is just another entry in the long list of dishes that will cause you to keel over from a myocardial infarction while shoveling a foot of snow out of the driveway shortly after you've retired; sometimes before. Nope, poutines as I know them are a different creature entirely. They seem to be more of an Acadian thing and none of my friends had even heard of them, much less eaten a single one. Because of the work involved, my mother only made poutines for special times: Christmas, say or Easter. My mother would borrow this grater that was about two feet long and she and my grandmother would set to work. Generally, they started off with an enormous paper sack of potatoes, about 25 pounds or so (We used to buy potatoes by the cartload and store them in a wooden bin in the basement. Because we were cheap labour, the kids would be sent down to retrieve a few for the family meal. It was creepy to descend into the dank cellar, feel our way through the dim obstacle course formed by my grandfather's thousands of tools and bits of wood and locate the bin. After a time in storage, the eyes on potatoes began to sprout pale tendrils and it didn't take much imagination to visualize all kinds...

Sentence 1: Arrangements were made for the pianist daughter of IOC vice president Kim Un Yong to rehearse with the Berlin Philharmonic when Berlin was seeking the 2000 Games. Sentence 2: Kim Un Yong's daughter rehearsed with the Berlin Philharmonic. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. In the first sentence, it is mentioned that \\"Arrangements were made for the pianist daughter of IOC vice president Kim Un Yong to rehearse with the Berlin Philharmonic when Berlin was seeking the 2000 Games.\\" This sentence conveys that there were plans put in place for Kim Un Yong's daughter, who is a pianist, to have a rehearsal with the Berlin Philharmonic during the time when Berlin was attempting to secure the 2000 Games. The second sentence, \\"Kim Un Yong's daughter rehearsed with the Berlin Philharmonic,\\" is a concise statement that implies the same fact as mentioned in the first sentence. It directly states that Kim Un Yong's daughter had a rehearsal with the Berlin Philharmonic. Although the second sentence does not provide details about the arrangements or the context of Berlin seeking the 2000 Games, it still conveys the core information that the daughter rehearsed with the Berlin Philharmonic. Furthermore, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, confirming that the information it provides is derived from the first sentence. Entailment in this context refers to the logical relationship between two sentences, where the truth of the first sentence guarantees the truth of the second sentence. In this case, the fact that arrangements were made for Kim Un Yong's daughter to rehearse with the Berlin Philharmonic inherently entails that the rehearsal took place. Thus, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence and provides a simplified version of the information conveyed in the first sentence."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: A Bite of China, made by CCTV's Documentary Channel, sparked discussion not only on Chinese food, but also on locally made documentary programs. When you think of documentaries, you may think of them as long, boring programs. But documentaries can be wonderful and bring stories from the real world into our homes. With fascinating footage and stories, documentaries encourage us to think about interesting issues we wouldn't necessarily know about. So, what makes a good documentary, and what should we pay attention to when we watch one? Here, we offer a few easy strategies to help you get the most out of watching documentaries. Pay attention to the themes While watching a documentary, keep your eyes and ears peeled for the themes people talk about and what ideas they focus on. Is it meant to be informative or raise a certain emotional response? Think critically Listen to what the people in the documentary are saying and ask yourself the following questions: If you were debating with someone or introducing a new concept, would you say the things the people in the documentary are saying? Do the arguments make sense? Check the sources If you're sitting at the computer and can't think of anything to do, why not look up the points the documentary made and see if they are accurate? You could even read more about what is presented in the documentary. Who are the creators? The creators or financial backers of a film will usually be involved with how the subject matter is presented. For instance, as the documentary 2016: Obama's America was directed in large part by a conservative writer, it's not surprising that it's critical of President Obama from the beginning. Question: Why is 2016: Obama's America mentioned in the article? Options: A: Because the author dislikes Obama. B: Because it is a persuasive example. C: Because it is quite popular in China.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. How is \\"Employees' time sheets are kept here too.\\" said in Russian?","completion":"The phrase \\"Employees' time sheets are kept here too.\\" can be translated into Russian as \\"Здесь также хранятся табели учета рабочего времени сотрудников.\\" Let's break this down for a deeper understanding: 1. Здесь (Zdes') - This is the Russian word for \\"here\\". In Russian, the word for \\"here\\" usually comes at the beginning of the sentence, unlike in English where it might be located elsewhere depending on the specific phrasing. 2. также (takzhe) - This is the word for \\"too\\" or \\"also\\". It is accommodatingly versatile in the sentence structure and can be placed almost anywhere in the sentence. 3. хранятся (hranyatsya) - This is the word for \\"are kept\\" or \\"are stored\\". In Russian, verbs are usually in the middle or towards the end of sentences, again unlike English. 4. табели учета рабочего времени (tabeli ucheta rabochego vremeni) - These words mean \\"time sheets\\" or literally, \\"charts of accounting of working time\\". Russian often describes concepts in a broader or more detailed way than English. This phrase is more literal to the concept of a timesheet logging work hours. 5. сотрудников (sotrudnikov) - This is the word for \\"employees\\". It is the plural form of the word \\"employee\\" (сотрудник) in the genitive case, which shows possession. While ordering of words in Russian sentences can be more flexible than in English due to the extensive case system, the given translation follows a typical and natural structure. However, you should note that Russian sentence structure can be complex due to its declension system, in which the endings of words change based on their role in the sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve 7*n = -73 + 38 for n. Solve this problem.","completion":"Alright, let's solve the equation step by step, as if I'm explaining to a five-year-old. We have the equation: 7 * n = -73 + 38 1. First, we need to add the two numbers on the right side. That's -73 and 38. Think of it like this: You owe someone 73 candies (that's the -73) but then you find 38 candies to pay back. So, you still owe: 73 (candies owed) - 38 (candies found) = 35 candies. In our equation, it looks like this: 7 * n = -35 2. Now, we need to find out what number (n) multiplied by 7 gives us -35. So, we need to divide -35 by 7. Remember that when we divide a negative number by a positive number, the answer is negative. In this case: -35 ÷ 7 = -5 So, n = -5. And there you have it! We found the number n; it is -5. Just like if you had 5 less than zero candies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

The context provides information about Eldrid Nordbø's career and personal life, detailing her positions in the Norwegian government and her marriage to Bjørn Skogstad Aamo.

Oslo is the capital of Norway and often serves as the location for political offices and activities. Eldrid Nordbø's political career, including her positions as personal secretary to the Minister of Social Affairs, state secretary to the prime minister, and Minister of Trade and Shipping, imply her involvement in Norway's political sphere.

Question: What country did Muller find himself in after the war? Title: The Juggler Movie plot: A man finds himself running from both the police and his own troubling memories in this drama. Hans Muller (Kirk Douglas), a German Jew, was once a well-known juggler before he was committed to a concentration camp; Muller survived, but his wife and children did not. After the war, Muller and many other displaced people found themselves in a temporary camp in Israel; his experiences have left him upset and confused, and several of the guards notice that he's behaving oddly. Muller flees the camp after one day, but while running away, he's stopped by Kogan (Richard Benedict), an Israeli policeman. When Kogan asks to see Muller's papers, he immediately flashes back to an unsetting memory in which a Nazi officer asked the same question; Muller panics, attacks the cop, and flees for Mount Carmel. In the morning, Muller encounters a group of children who believe the story he tells them: that he's a tourist from the United States. One of them, Yehoshua (Joseph Walsh), is making his way to a kibbutz in Syria, and Muller, who hopes to get to some friends in Egypt, joins him. Muller entertains the young man by teaching him to juggle, and they become close friends. When Yehoshua is injured by a land mine, Muller rushes him to a hospital, where he meets Ya'el (Milly Vitale), a woman who lost her husband to Arabs. A romance soon blossoms between Muller and Ya'el, and he confesses to her that he's on the run from the police; meanwhile, Israeli Detective Karni (Paul Stewart) is combing the nation, searching for the juggler -- not to arrest him, but to convince him that he's not wanted for murder, and that others want to help him.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Objective: Reflect photography light. Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Options are: (i) Layer cardboard with foil.; (ii) Layer cardboard with newspaper.;","completion":"In terms of naive physics reasoning, we can determine which solution is more sound for reflecting photography light by examining the materials used and their abilities to reflect light efficiently. The two options provided are layering cardboard with foil (i) and layering cardboard with newspaper (ii). We will analyze both options based on their properties and how well they serve the objective of reflecting photography light. Option (i) Layer cardboard with foil: Foil is a metallic-coated material, and due to its shiny surface, it has a high capacity to reflect light. When light rays hit the foil surface, most of the rays get reflected, causing the light to bounce off its surface, creating a bright and consistent effect. In the context of photography, using a foil-layered cardboard can help control and direct light to achieve better illumination and properly lit subjects. In addition to excellent reflective properties, a foil layer would also be relatively easy to apply to the cardboard. Foil's thin and malleable nature allows it to be easily molded to the cardboard, ensuring that the surface remains as smooth and flat as needed for optimal light reflection. Option (ii) Layer cardboard with newspaper: Newspaper is made of paper, which is not a very efficient material for reflecting light. While paper can reflect some light, it doesn't possess the same reflective characteristics as a metallic surface like foil. The light-reflecting properties of newspaper are significantly lower as it tends to absorb light, which results in a lesser amount of light being reflected back. Additionally, newspapers have text and images printed on their surface, which can make the reflection uneven and inconsistent. These inconsistencies can have adverse effects on lighting quality and make it difficult to achieve the desired level of illumination in photography. Based on the analysis of the two options, layering cardboard with foil (Option i) is the more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning. The foil's reflective properties provide a vastly improved ability to manipulate and control light in photography compared to the newspaper's relatively poor light reflection ability. Foil's reflectivity ensures that the subjects and scenes being photographed receive the appropriate lighting, thus contributing to better photography outcomes. In contrast, layering cardboard with newspaper (Option ii) would not be as efficient or effective in reflecting and controlling photography light due to its limitations in reflecting light and the inconsistencies arising from the printed surface."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The album was released both in South Korea and China by S.M. Entertainment, a major South Korean entertainment company, and distributed by KT Music, another South Korean music company. Let's break down the details provided and analyze whether we can infer that the album is not written by Chinese individuals: 1. Lay (Zhang Yixing) - Zhang Yixing, known professionally as Lay, is a Chinese singer, songwriter, and actor. His nationality and background could suggest his involvement in the creative process with regards to the songwriting and composition. 2. Released in South Korea and China – Even though the album was released in these two countries, it doesn't solidify the idea that Chinese writers were not involved in creating the album. In fact, the Chinese release might indicate that there could be a level of Chinese representation in the music. 3. S.M. Entertainment - This South Korean entertainment company is responsible for producing and managing a variety of popular artists from different countries, including China. Its roster of artists may have collaborated with Lay and contributed to the development of the \\"Lose Control\\" EP. Although the album's contents might be influenced by South Korean music production, it should be noted that Zhang Yixing, being Chinese himself, would have likely contributed his own cultural and personal touch to the music. Furthermore, he has written and composed songs in the past. In this EP, Lay is credited as the songwriter, composer, and producer for all six tracks on \\"Lose Control.\\" This validates that the content of the album indeed has a strong Chinese influence. In conclusion, based on the given information, it cannot be inferred that \\"Lose Control\\" is not written by a Chinese individual, considering Lay's significant role in the creation and production of his solo debut extended play."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere.

The two sides of Istanbul's metro are connected under the Bosphorus by the Marmaray tunnel, inaugurated in 2013 as the first rail connection between Thrace and Anatolia. Until then, buses provide transportation within and between the two halves of the city, accommodating 2.2 million passenger trips each day. The Metrobus, a form of bus rapid transit, crosses the Bosphorus Bridge, with dedicated lanes leading to its termini. İDO (Istanbul Seabuses) runs a combination of all-passenger ferries and car-and-passenger ferries to ports on both sides of the Bosphorus, as far north as the Black Sea. With additional destinations around the Sea of Marmara, İDO runs the largest municipal ferry operation in the world. The city's main cruise ship terminal is the Port of Istanbul in Karaköy, with a capacity of 10,000 passengers per hour. Most visitors enter Istanbul by air, but about half a million foreign tourists enter the city by sea each year. International rail service from Istanbul launched in 1889, with a line between Bucharest and Istanbul's Sirkeci Terminal, which ultimately became famous as the eastern terminus of the Orient Express from Paris. Regular service to Bucharest and Thessaloniki continued until the early 2010s, when the former was interrupted for Marmaray construction and the latter was halted due to economic problems in Greece. After Istanbul's Haydarpaşa Terminal opened in 1908, it served as the western terminus of the Baghdad Railway and an extension of the Hejaz Railway; today, neither service is offered directly from Istanbul. Service to Ankara and other points across Turkey is normally offered by Turkish State Railways, but the construction of Marmaray and the Ankara-Istanbul high-speed line forced the station to close in 2012. New stations to replace both the Haydarpaşa and Sirkeci terminals, and...

Answer the following question: Information: - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Hummingbirds are birds from the Americas that constitute the family Trochilidae. They are among the smallest of birds, most species measuring . Indeed, the smallest extant bird species is a hummingbird, the 5-cm bee hummingbird weighing less than a U.S. penny (2.5 g). - Mitrospingus is a genus of bird formerly in the family Thraupidae . Established by Robert Ridgway in 1898 , it contains the following species : Dusky - faced tanager ( Mitrospingus cassinii ) Olive - backed tanager ( Mitrospingus oleagineus ) The name Mitrospingus is a combination of the Greek words mitra meaning \`\` cap '' or \`\` head - dress '' and spingos , meaning \`\` finch '' . - The ostrich or common ostrich (\\"Struthio camelus\\") is either one or two species of large flightless birds native to Africa, the only living member(s) of the genus \\"Struthio\\", which is in the ratite family. In 2014, the Somali ostrich (\\"Struthio molybdophanes\\") was recognized as a distinct species. What is the relationship between 'mitrospingus' and 'the americas'? Answer:","completion":"There is no direct relationship between 'Mitrospingus' and 'the Americas.' Mitrospingus is a genus of birds, which includes species like the Dusky-faced Tanager (Mitrospingus cassinii) and Olive-backed Tanager (Mitrospingus oleagineus). These birds are not specifically related to 'the Americas,' as the term refers to a group of hummingbirds native to the Americas, which are distinct from the Mitrospingus genus. The relationship between Mitrospingus and the Americas can be understood through the broader context of the diverse bird species found in the regions of North, Central, and South America. Both hummingbirds and Mitrospingus belong to the avian species characteristic of the Americas, but they are different types of birds that belong to separate families and genera."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"The origins of the police force in America can be traced back to the early 17th century, but the official formation of a structured force is more closely associated with the 19th century. It is essential to look at different periods and regions to understand the development of policing in the United States accurately. In the 1630s, the colonies in North America adopted a system known as \\"night watch,\\" which was primarily used in England. This system involved volunteers who were appointed to patrol the streets at night, focusing on maintaining order, watching out for criminals, and assisting in extinguishing fires. The night watch was a temporary, informal, and rather ineffective policing system that continued well into the 19th century. However, the first officially recognized and publicly funded police force was established in Boston in 1838, which is often considered the starting point of the American police system. The primary motivation for the creation of this force was to maintain civil order and control over an increasingly urbanized and industrious population. During this time, cities like New York, Albany, and Philadelphia also began establishing formal police departments. The New York City Police Department (NYPD), founded in 1845, is one of the oldest and largest police forces in the United States. It was modeled after London's Metropolitan Police and was predominantly created to address the growing concerns of crime and public disorder associated with rapid urbanization and immigration. In the mid to late 19th century, the concept of modern policing began to emerge, under the guidance and influence of leaders such as Sir Robert Peel in England. The key principles of this new approach to policing were to prevent crime, work closely with communities, and maintain strict standards of professionalism, ethical conduct, and impartial law enforcement. These principles deeply influenced the establishment and evolution of police departments in the United States. The establishment of the police force in America occurred at different times across various states and regions. The modernization and expansion of police forces took place primarily between the 1830s and the turn of the 20th century. The role of the police has continued to evolve over time, addressing contemporary social issues such as civil rights, community policing, and crime reduction strategies to further adapt to the needs of society."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: - The trees and plants burn - The animals lose their homes - If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation - The plants that provide food are gone - The animals have little to eat - What might be the first step of the process?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is an article: (Want to get California Today by email? Sign up.) Dozens of California cities looking to shore up revenues are flirting with a new idea — tax your “Gilmore Girls” binge. Pasadena was among the first to say publicly this fall that it wanted to tax video streaming services like Netflix, a step that could make up for lost tax revenue from growing numbers of cord-cutters. At 9.4 percent, the so-called Netflix tax would treat streaming services as a traditional utility, the city said. If you use multiple services — for example, Hulu, Amazon Video and HBO — it would be added to each bill. The move in Pasadena, with a population of about 140,000, has drawn consternation from technology companies and consumers who worry that it could be copied across the state. “Websites and apps are not utilities and it defies logic to tax them like electricity, water or gas,” said Noah Theran, spokesman for the Internet Association, a trade group. No California city has yet to begin collecting the tax. But roughly 40 cities, among them Glendale, Santa Barbara, Stockton and Sacramento, have gotten guidance from municipal consultants on how they might. Public officials have argued that taxation rules need to be revised to account for changing technologies. It is unfair, some say, that people who get video through cable television are taxed while those who have shifted over to internet streaming services are not. One question officials would need to resolve is where to stop, analysts say. If streaming video is taxable, then what about music, podcasts or video games? “It opens a big Pandora’s box,” said Paul Verna, an analyst at eMarketer, a technology research company. Mr. Verna said many of the streaming video tax proposals in California have bubbled up under the radar. If there is to be a larger debate, it will erupt when people start seeing their bills, he said. For now, the proposed tax is “under internal review,” William Boyer, a Pasadena city spokesman, said in an email. Tyron Hampton, a council member who has opposed the tax, said that with the city’s underfunded pensions, officials were right to be looking for novel ways to raise money. But the web should be off limits, he said: “The basic tenet of the internet is that the internet is supposed to be free.” • Officials in so-called sanctuary cities say they will act as a bulwark against mass deportations, even at the risk of losing federal money.

But another sort of rebellion occurred in Northern California long before Election Day. It was this week in 1941 that a group of miners halted traffic along Route 99 in Siskiyou County and handed out proclamations to motorists declaring the formation of Jefferson, a new state named after the author of the Declaration of Independence. With Yreka as its capital, Jefferson would include parts of both Oregon and California where resentments had simmered over the supposed neglect of politicians in the capitals of Salem and Sacramento. The journalist Lawrence E. Davies described the scene in the Nov. 28 edition of The New York Times: “Bonfires blazed along the main north-south highway winding through the towering Siskiyous tonight as determined mining men, with pistols in their belts, stopped motorists and distributed yellow handbills proclaiming ‘independence’ of a group of Oregon and California counties.” The agitators complained that the region was deprived of proper roads needed to transport their copper ore and timber. They vowed to barricade the highway every Thursday until their demands were met. But the uprising was to be short-lived. Gilbert Gable, the mayor of Port Orford, Ore., who had initiated the Jefferson movement and led its public relations effort, died on Dec. 2. Five days after that, Pearl Harbor was attacked. And the mood for rebellion was eclipsed by the war effort. Now, more than seven decades later, the movement for a state of Jefferson remains a hot issue in Northern California. In 2013, the Siskiyou County board of supervisors approved a declaration that called for breaking away from the state. The complaints echo those of the miners in the 1940s: chiefly, a perceived lack of representation in Sacramento. California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

Information: - Archosaurs are a group of diapsid amniotes whose living representatives consist of birds and crocodilians. This group also includes all extinct non-avian dinosaurs, extinct crocodilian relatives, and pterosaurs. Archosauria, the archosaur clade, is a crown group that includes the most recent common ancestor of living birds and crocodilians. It includes two main clades: Pseudosuchia, which includes crocodilians and their extinct relatives, and Ornithosuchia, which includes birds and their extinct relatives (such as non-avian dinosaurs and pterosaurs). - Desmatosuchinae is one of the two subfamilies of aetosaurs, the other being Aetosaurinae. It is a stem-based taxon defined as all aetosaurs more closely related to \\"Desmatosuchus\\" than the last common ancestor of \\"Desmatosuchus\\" and \\"Stagonolepis\\". All synapomorphies that diagnose the clade can be found in the osteoderms. These include tongue-and-groove articulations for lateral plates present in dorsal presacral paramedian plates and large spikes on the lateral cervical, dorsal, and caudal plates. - Aetosaurinae is one of the two subfamilies of aetosaurs , the other being Desmatosuchinae . It is a stem - based taxon defined as all aetosaurs more closely related to Aetosaurus than to the last common ancestor of Aetosaurus and Desmatosuchus . The only synapomorphy that diagnoses the clade Aetosaurinae is the medial offset of the dorsal eminences of the paramedian osteoderms . A phylogenetic study in 2012 found Aetosaurinae to be paraphyletic , with Aetosaurus being the basal-most stagonolepidid and aetosaurines like Calyptosuchus , Neoaetosauroides , and the newly described Aetobarbakinoides being successively more derived taxa leading up to a clade containing Desmatosuchinae and Typothoracisinae . Under this phylogeny , most traditional aetosaurines are more closely related to Desmatosuchus than they are to Aetosaurus , and the clade Aetosaurinae can only include Aetosaurus . - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry. - Desmatosuchus (from Greek \\"desmos\\" 'link' + \\"soûkhos\\" 'crocodile') is an extinct genus of archosaur belonging to the Order Aetosauria. It lived during the Late Triassic. - Neoaetosauroides is an extinct genus of primitive aetosaur. Its type and only species is \\"N. engaeus\\". Fossils have been found from the Los Colorados Formation outcropping along the Sierra Morada River in La Rioja, Argentina, and date back to the Norian age of the Late Triassic. It was the first aetosaur known from the formation, with remains being discovered in the 1960s. - In biology, phylogenetics (Greek: , - \\"phylé\\", \\"phylon\\" = tribe, clan, race + - \\"genetikós\\" = origin, source, birth) is the study of the evolutionary history and relationships among individuals or groups of organisms (e.g. species, or populations). These relationships are discovered through phylogenetic inference methods that evaluate observed heritable traits, such as DNA sequences or morphology under a model of evolution of these traits. The result of these analyses is a phylogeny (also known as a phylogenetic tree) a diagrammatic hypothesis about the history of the evolutionary relationships of a group of organisms. The tips of a phylogenetic tree can be living organisms or fossils, and represent the \\"end,\\" or the present, in an evolutionary lineage. Phylogenetic analyses have become central to understanding biodiversity, evolution, ecology, and genomes. - Aetosaurus is an extinct genus of archosaur reptile belonging to the order Aetosauria. It is generally considered to be the most primitive aetosaur. Three species are currently recognized: \\"A. ferratus\\", the type species from Germany and Italy; \\"A. crassicauda\\" from Germany; and \\"A. arcuatus\\" from eastern North America. Additional specimens referred to \\"Aetosaurus\\" have been found from South Africa, the Chinle Group of the southwestern United States, and the Fleming Fjord Formation of Greenland. Specimens of \\"Aetosaurus\\" occur in Norian-age strata. - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. - The Late Triassic is the third and final of three epochs of the Triassic Period in the geologic timescale. The Triassic-Jurassic extinction event began during this epoch and is one of the five major mass extinction events of the Earth. The corresponding series is known as the Upper Triassic. In Europe the epoch was called the Keuper, after a German lithostratigraphic group (a sequence of rock strata) that has a roughly corresponding age. The Late Triassic spans the time between Ma and Ma (million years ago). The Late Triassic is divided into the Carnian, Norian and Rhaetian ages. - Typothoracisinae is a clade of aetosaurs within the subfamily Aetosaurinae. It is a stem-based taxon defined as all aetosaurs closer to \\"Typothorax\\" than to \\"Stagonolepis\\" or \\"Desmatosuchus\\". As with many aetosaur taxa, most of the synapomorphies that diagnose the clade are found in the osteoderms. These include a strongly acute angle of flexion between the dorsal and lateral flanges of the dorsal and lateral plates and triangular-shaped pelvic and anterior caudal dorsal lateral plates possessing semicircular borders and hook-like eminences. - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\". - Emil Hans Willi Hennig (April 20, 1913 November 5, 1976) was a German biologist who is considered the founder of phylogenetic systematics, also known as cladistics. In 1945 as a prisoner of war, Hennig began work on his theory of cladistics, which he published in 1950. With his works on evolution and systematics he revolutionised the view of the natural order of beings. As a taxonomist, he specialised in dipterans (ordinary flies and mosquitoes). - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - In biology and genealogy, the most recent common ancestor (MRCA, also \\"last common ancestor\\" LCA, or \\"concestor\\") of any set of organisms is the most recent individual from which all organisms in a group, for are directly descended. The term is also used reference to the ancestry of groups of genes (haplotypes) rather than organisms. - In biological classification, a subfamily (Latin: ', plural ') is an auxiliary (intermediate) taxonomic rank, next below family but more inclusive than genus. Standard nomenclature rules end subfamily botanical names with \\"-oideae\\", and zoological names with \\"-inae\\". - In phylogenetics, apomorphy and synapomorphy refer to derived characteristic of a clade. Apomorphy implies a characteristic that is different from the form of an ancestor, i.e., an innovation, of use in determining membership in a clade. Synapomorphy is a shared derived character or trait state that distinguishes a clade from other organisms. In other words, it is an apomorphy shared by members of a monophyletic group, and thus assumed to be present in their most recent common ancestor. The word synapomorphy, coined by German entomologist Willi Hennig, is derived from the Greek words ', \\"syn\\" = shared; ', \\"apo\\" = away from; and \\"\\", \\"morphe\\" = shape.A - In zoological nomenclature, a type species (\\"species typica\\") is the species name with which the name of a genus or subgenus is considered to be permanently taxonomically associated, i.e., the species that contains the biological type specimen(s). A similar concept is used for suprageneric groups called a type genus. - Calyptosuchus (meaning \\"covered crocodile\\") is an extinct genus of crurotarsan from the Late Triassic of North America. As an aetosaur, it was heavily armored and had a pig-like snout used to uproot plants. The genus might be a junior synonym of \\"Stagonolepis\\". - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals. - Typothorax is an extinct genus of typothoracisine aetosaur that lived in the Late Triassic. Its remains have been found in North America. Two species are known: \\"T. coccinarum\\", the type species, and \\"T. antiquum\\". - Stagonolepis is an extinct genus of stagonolepidid aetosaur known from the Late Triassic (Carnian stage) of Europe. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - A clade (from , \\"klados\\", \\"branch\\") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single \\"branch\\" on the \\"tree of life\\". - Aetosaurs (\\"aetosaur\\" ; order name \\"Aetosauria\\" ; from Greek, (aetos, \\"eagle\\") and (sauros, \\"lizard\\")) are an extinct order of heavily armoured, medium- to large-sized Late Triassic herbivorous archosaurs. They have small heads, upturned snouts, erect limbs, and a body covered by plate-like scutes. All aetosaurs belong to the family Stagonolepididae. Two distinct subdivisions of aetosaurs are currently recognized, Desmatosuchinae and Aetosaurinae, based primarily on differences in the morphology of the bony scutes of the two groups. Over 20 genera of aetosaurs have been described, and recently there has been controversy regarding the description of some of these genera.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Brock Edward Lesnar was born on July 12, 1977 in Webster, South Dakota, the son of Stephanie and Richard Lesnar, and grew up on his parents' dairy farm in Webster. He is of German descent. He has two older brothers, Troy and Chad, and a younger sister, Brandi. At age 17, Lesnar joined the Army National Guard, where he was assigned to an office job after his red-green colorblindness was deemed hazardous to his desire to work with explosives. Lesnar's next defense was against undefeated top contender Cain Velasquez on October 23 at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California at UFC 121. Dana White announced via SportsNation that the UFC would bring back UFC Primetime to hype the fight. Lesnar was defeated by Velasquez for the title by TKO in the first round. On January 11, 2011, Lesnar was announced as a coach of The Ultimate Fighter Season 13, opposite Junior dos Santos, with the two expected to fight on June 11 at UFC 131, but he was struck with another bout of diverticulitis and had to withdraw from the fight on May 12. He was replaced by Shane Carwin, who ended up losing against dos Santos. Lesnar underwent surgery on May 27 to help battle his problems with diverticulitis. Dana White said that he had a 12-inch piece of his colon removed. In its May 2011 issue, ESPN's magazine published a story listing the highest paid athlete based on base salary and earnings for the most recent calendar year or most recent season in 30 sports. Lesnar topped the list for MMA at 5.3 million, which included his reported bout salaries and estimated pay-per-view bonuses. In the summer of 2011, Lesnar announced that he was returning to action, stating, \\"I feel like a new man. Healthy. Strong. I feel like I used to feel\\". His return match was scheduled to be at UFC 141 on December 30 in Las Vegas against former Strikeforce heavyweight champion Alistair Overeem. Overeem won the fight by way of technical knockout in the first round.

Speculation about a return to MMA lasted until March 24, 2015, when Lesnar announced in an interview on SportsCenter that he had re-signed with WWE and officially closed the door on a return to MMA, even though he was offered a deal \\"ten times more\\" than what he had made previously in his MMA career. He further elaborated that, while he was training for months for a return to the UFC, he felt \\"physically great but something was lacking mentally\\". Lesnar added that \\"[he's] an older caveman now, so [he] makes smarter caveman decisions\\" and that he chose to sign with WWE instead of returning to MMA because he could \\"work part-time with full-time pay\\".

Summarize this article: Tokyo (CNN) Authorities have discovered the bodies of six people, including a 7-year-old girl, at a house in the Japanese town of Takachiho, a popular destination for tourists visiting the Takachiho Gorge in southwestern Miyazaki province. Police found the remains at a house owned by 72-year-old Yasuo Iihoshi after a family member had reported that his calls had gone unanswered, according to Miyazaki prefectural police. One of the bodies, a female, was discovered outside the property, while three males and two more females were found inside the house. Japan, which ranks as one of the safest countries in the world to live, has a very low murder rate and mass killings are rare. Given Japan's strict gun laws, in the infrequent attacks that do occur, knives are more commonly used. In the Takachiho killings, at least some of the victims had been stabbed, local media reported. The murder weapon has not been recovered. Read More ||||| Officials in Miyazaki prefecture urge people to be careful and keep close eye on children after gruesome discovery Residents of a remote village in south-western Japan are coming to terms with a gruesome mass murder after six people, including five members of the same family, were found dead inside a farmhouse. Police said they later discovered the body of a seventh person who had jumped or fallen from a nearby bridge into a river in Takachiho, Miyazaki prefecture, a mountain village of 12,000 people and a popular tourist destination. Investigators discovered the body of a woman outside the house and the bodies of five other people, including a young girl, inside, on Monday. Media reports said some of the victims appeared to have been stabbed. Police named three of them as Mihoko Iihoshi, the 66-year-old wife of the house’s owner, 72-year-old farmer Yasuo Iihoshi, their seven-year-old granddaughter Yui and a male acquaintance, 44-year-old Fumiaki Matsuoka. The bodies of the remaining three victims – two men and a woman – were yet to be publicly identified. Police went to the house after a relative told them his calls to the family had gone unanswered, according to Kyodo news. The seventh body, whom police believe could be that of Yasuo Iihoshi’s son, was found in a river about three kilometres away. It appeared he had driven to the bridge in the family car. The area is near Takachiho valley, a popular tourist destination known for its scenic gorge and connections to Japan’s indigenous religion Shinto. The discovery sparked fear among residents, with local officials urging people to exercise caution and collect their children from school, Kyodo said. Mass killings are a rarity in Japan, which is considered one of the safest countries in the world, thanks in part to its strict gun laws. However, killings carried out with knives occasionally make headlines. In 2001 a man with a history of mental illness forced his way into a primary school in Osaka and fatally stabbed eight children aged between six and eight. In 2008 seven people were killed when a man slammed a truck into a crowd on a busy shopping street in central Tokyo and then launched a frenzied knife attack. In July 2016 Satoshi Uematsu, who claimed he wanted to make people with disabilities “disappear”, killed 19 people and injured 27 others in a knife attack at a care facility in Sagamihara, south of Tokyo. ||||| TAKACHIHO, Miyazaki Prefecture--Police are investigating the deaths of seven people here as a possible murder-suicide after a body was retrieved from a river near the Takachiho-kyo gorge sightseeing spot on Nov. 27. The body was identified as Masahiro Iihoshi, 42, whose car was discovered near a bridge in the town. Police suspect he committed suicide by jumping into the Gokasegawa river. The six people, found dead on Nov. 26, were all stabbed, according to investigative sources. Five of the bodies in the house were identified as members of the Iihoshi family: Yasuo, 72, his wife, Mihoko, 66, Masahiro’s wife, Mikiko, 41, their 21-year-old son, Takumi, and his 7-year-old daughter, Yui. Masahiro is the second son of Yasuo and Mihoko. The other body in the house was identified as Fumiaki Matsuoka, 44, a friend of Masahiro who lives in Gokase in the same prefecture. Matsuoka was visiting the Iihoshi family to help resolve domestic problems involving Masahiro, according to investigative sources. Around 10:20 a.m. on Nov. 26, relatives living outside the town alerted police after they were unable to contact the family members by phone. When police arrived around 11 a.m., they found the body of an older woman, likely Mihoko, outside the house. The five other bodies were discovered inside the house. At 4 p.m., they found the seventh body in the river just under the bridge, the sources said. |||||","completion":"In a town called Takachiho in Japan, the police found the bodies of six people, including a little 7-year-old girl, in a house.

SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \`\`Tobacco Regulatory Fairness Act of 2000''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) Cigarette smoking and tobacco use cause approximately 450,000 deaths each year in the United States.

(5) Each day 3,000 children try cigarettes for the first time, many of whom become lifelong addicted smokers. (6) There is no minimum age requirement in Federal law that an individual must reach to legally buy cigarettes and other tobacco products.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. The letterhead on correspondence still bears the Bexar County Legal Aid name, even though the organization is no longer. Texas Rural Legal Aid - known for its fearless and sometimes controversial advocacy of the poorest of the poor - last week took over four other corporations serving the legal needs of the indigent in Southwest Texas, including the one in Bexar County. The new 68-county legal aid organization has yet to be named and stretches from El Paso to Corpus Christi, Harlingen to Austin. The leader for the super-sized law firm has big plans. \\"I'm more interested in looking at what we as advocates can do to address the serious problems of poverty than the number of cases we close,\\" said David Hall, the TRLA executive director. In the Rio Grande Valley, Hall's attorneys set up separate groups to assist small-business owners and residents with low-interest loans and legal representation. They also operate a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky. Now, Hall said, he wants to make services to the poor more efficient by working with law students who will handle less complicated legal matters, allowing licensed attorneys to take more \\"high impact\\" cases to court. \\"What we need to do is handle cases as efficiently as we can, leveraging the amount of time of the lawyer that goes in there and maximizing the number of people that they can help at one time,\\" Hall said. His plan is to place the 110 attorneys on staff in teams working on specialized legal issues. He wants to expand the law clinic it already has with St. Mary's University Law School to involve students at the University of Texas Law School. The law students at St. Mary's interview potential clients, assist them with filling out legal documents and answer the telephones for the legal hotline, freeing up TRLA lawyers to handle the complicated cases, Hall said. By the end of September, Hall said all the attorneys working with the poor in the 68county area will be placed on the same computer network so they can pass cases to the best available attorneys. Last year, board members on the former Legal Aid of Central Texas and Bexar County Legal Aid resisted the merger, saying that the mergers were done illegally and without the input of board members. They also argued that Hall's litigious style hampered their ability to garner funds from Congress. TRLA generated controversy in 1996, when its attorneys challenged the rights of 800 military personnel to vote in Val Verde County elections by absentee ballot after a former Ku Klux Klan member won a county commissioner post. Brendan Gill, the former executive director of the Bexar County group, said he has since come to see the merger as a positive move for South Texas. \\"I always knew there were good points to merging, just as I knew that there were bad points,\\" Gill said.

When the blood from these vessels accumulates in the tissues, it can produce a range of colors such as red, blue, purple, and eventually dark green or yellow, as the body works to break it down and absorb it. The comical aspect of treating a black eye with a cold steak has appeared in movies and television shows as a form of home remedy. The purpose behind using a cold steak originates from the benefits of applying cold temperatures to the affected area. When cold is applied to an injury or swelling, it helps in constricting blood vessels, reducing ongoing bleeding beneath the skin, and minimizing inflammation. Cold therapy can temporarily alleviate pain and discomfort by numbing the area as well. While using a cold steak for treating a black eye might be a popular and amusing concept, it's not the most efficient or sanitary method, as a raw steak could introduce bacteria into the area around the eye, which might lead to infection. Instead, it is recommended to use more sterile and practical methods to treat a black eye, such as: 1. Applying a cold pack: Wrap a bag of ice or a bag of frozen peas in a thin towel and gently place it on the affected area for 15-20 minutes several times a day. It is important to avoid applying the ice directly on the skin to prevent frostbite. 2. Keeping the head elevated: Elevating the head, especially while sleeping, helps reduce the accumulation of fluid in the injured area and minimizes swelling. 3. Taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication: Medications like ibuprofen can help alleviate pain and reduce inflammation. However, it is crucial to consult a doctor or pharmacist before taking any medication. 4. Avoiding hot compresses: In the first few days after the injury, it’s essential to avoid warm or hot compresses, as heat may increase the swelling. It is important to monitor the symptoms of a black eye, and if they worsen or do not get better within a few days, one should seek medical attention. Furthermore, any vision disturbances, dizziness, or severe pain associated with the injury should prompt immediate consultation with a healthcare professional."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ukraine official: Russia has launched 'armed invasion' in Crimea Russian troops moved into Crimea Friday, U.S. officials told Fox News, prompting Ukraine to accuse Russia of an \\"armed invasion.\\" At the White House, President Obama said the U.S. government is \\"deeply concerned\\" by reports of Russian \\"military movements\\" and warned any violation of Ukraine's sovereignty would be \\"deeply destabilizing.\\" \\"There will be costs\\" for any military intervention, he said, without specifying what those costs might be. U.S. officials told Fox News they see “evidence of air and maritime movement into and out of Crimea by Russian forces” although the Pentagon declined to officially \\"characterize\\" the movement. Agence France Press quoted a top Ukranian official as saying Russian aircraft carrying nearly 2,000 suspected troops have landed at a military air base near the regional capital of the restive Crimean peninsula. \\"Thirteen Russian aircraft landed at the airport of Gvardeyskoye (near Simferopol) with 150 people in each one,\\" Sergiy Kunitsyn, the Ukrainian president's special representative in Crimea, told the local ATR television channel, according to AFP. He accused Russia of an \\"armed invasion.\\" The new developments prompted Ukraine to accuse Russia of a \\"military invasion and occupation\\" -- a claim that brought an alarming new dimension to the crisis. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, issued a statement late Friday saying, \\"It appears that the Russian military now controls the Crimean peninsula. This aggression is a threat not only to Ukraine, but to regional peace and stability. Russia’s latest action is yet another indicator that Vladimir Putin’s hegemonic ambitions threaten U.S. interests and allies around the world.\\" Russia kept silent on claims of military intervention, even as it maintained its hard-line stance on protecting ethnic Russians in Crimea, a peninsula of Ukraine on the northern coast of the Black Sea. A spokesman for the Ukrainian border service said eight Russian transport planes have landed in Crimea with unknown cargo. Serhiy Astakhov told The Associated Press that the Il-76 planes arrived unexpectedly Friday and were given permission to land, one after the other, at Gvardeiskoye air base, north of the regional capital, Simferopol. Astakhov said the people in the planes refused to identify themselves and waved off customs officials, saying they didn't require their services. Earlier in the day, Russian armored vehicles rumbled across Crimea and reports surfaced of troops being deployed at airports and a coast guard base – signs of a more heavy-handed approach to the crisis from Moscow. Ukraine's U.N. ambassador Yuriy Sergeyev told the U.N. Security Council that Russian military helicopters and transport planes are entering his country, that neither major airport in Ukraine is under national control and that the main airport was \\"captured by Russian armed forces.\\" He claimed 11 Russian military helicopters had been brought in along with M-24 military transport planes. Armed gunmen took control of the two main airports in Crimea Friday. However, Russia has so far been silent on the claims of military involvement. No violence was reported at the civilian airport in Crimea's capital of Simferopol or at the military airport in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol, also part of Crimea. At the Simferopol airport, a man claiming to speak for the camouflage-clad forces patrolling the airport described them as Crimean militiamen. Meanwhile, ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych surfaced in Russia Friday, thundering defiantly against the “pro-fascist hooligans” who drove him from office. Yanukovych warned of the dangers of “irresponsible Western policy” as he vowed to continue the fight for Ukraine’s future Friday at a press conference in Rostov-on-don, Russia—his first public appearance since last Saturday. \\"I intend to keep fighting for the future of Ukraine against those who are using fear and terror to seize the country,\\" he told reporters. The fugitive leader said he was forced to leave Ukraine due to threats, Reuters reported. He blamed the country’s crisis on “irresponsible Western policy,” and said he trusted the \\"decency of Western mediators” when he signed a peace deal last week brokered by members of the European Union. But recent actions by the opposition run counter to the agreement, he said. Yanukovych said he does not plan to ask Russia for military support in dealing with the crisis in Ukraine, where he said power was stolen by \`\`a bunch of radicals.” \\"Fascist hooligans\\" have taken power in Ukraine, Yanukovych told reporters, according to the BBC.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Jimbob Blakey wasn't so much given birth to as clambered right out of his mother himself. He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: does jimbob have any friends? Options: - not enough information - no - everyone is afraid so no - nobody would hold him so probably not The answer to this question is:","completion":"- not enough information"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize: Make sure you are watching a scary movie with other people close by you. Invite more friends, family, or even pets if you’re watching the movie at home. Talk to friends about the movie and whether or not they think they’ll get scared. It can help to know that most people get scared by horror movies, whether they admit it or not, because that’s the purpose of scary movies! If you’re watching in a movie theater, make sure you have people you know on either side of you, if possible, without empty seats, strangers, or an aisle next to you which could make you feel less comfortable. You can even ask a friend if they’re okay with you squeezing their hand or getting closer to them during scary parts. Most people are happy to help you feel at ease! Watch it with your girl/boyfriend; scary movies are often something that people bond over. See a movie in a room with the lights on, if possible. Get comfortable on a couch, chair, or the floor so you feel more safe. Avoid watching the movie while it’s dark outside, or when you have to go to sleep directly afterwards. Watch a DVD during the day, or catch a matinee at a theater. Sit in a place next to the wall. You don't want to feel like something is behind you. You can even encourage watching a movie in a room of the house where other things are going on around you. This might help to distract you and remind you of reality during the movie. Wear a comfortable hoodie sweatshirt or other item of clothing that makes you feel warm and secure. Wrap yourself in a blanket if you want, or hug a pillow to your chest. Wear a hoodie to a movie theater as a way to stay warm in the typically cold space, stay comfortable, and even hide your face with the hood if you want to. Share a blanket with a friend to help you feel close to someone and be extra warm. Warmth and comfort will help the shivers or vulnerable feeling you get when you’re scared. Get familiar with the movie you’re watching before you see it in the theater or in someone’s home. Knowing more about what will happen in the plot will help you be less surprised by the scary parts. Watch a trailer, and any other available scenes from the movie you can find online. You will already be prepared for the scary visuals that they often show in the trailers if you watch them beforehand. You can even listen to the soundtrack beforehand if it’s available online. Do a happy, simple activity during the day while you listen to it and it won’t seem threatening. The soundtrack often makes scary parts of the movie much scarier, but not if you take the fear out of the music ahead of time. If you’ve already seen the movie, you can still refresh your memory by reading or watching content related to it, or just know that you will likely be less scared by something you’ve already seen.","completion":"To comfortably watch a scary movie, ensure you have company, such as friends, family or pets. Preferably watch during the day in a well-lit room, surrounded by familiar people. Sit close to a wall and wear comfortable, warm clothing like a hoodie or wrap yourself in a blanket.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Process: - The human body takes a breath inward - Air is transported to the lungs - Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs - In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries - The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood - The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells - The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme - Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues - Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen - The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue - suppose more energy absorbed happens, how will it affect less air reaches the alveoli. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation of more energy being absorbed, resulting in less air reaching the alveoli, would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. Here's the reasoning: The process of oxygen transport in the human body involves various steps, as mentioned in the question. None of these steps specifically address energy absorption. However, if more energy is absorbed, it could potentially affect various physiological factors and lead to less air reaching the alveoli. For example, increased energy absorption could cause the body to generate more heat, leading to a higher body temperature. This could potentially impact the respiratory rate or efficiency, indirectly causing less air to reach the alveoli. Additionally, any obstruction or changes in the airway, bronchioles, or lung function due to the increased energy absorption can also indirectly impact the air reaching the alveoli. In summary, the supposed perturbation of more energy absorption, causing less air to reach the alveoli, would be indirectly impacting a step of the process, as it potentially influences other physiological factors that could then affect the oxygen transport process."},{"prompt":"Information: - The New York City Subway is a rapid transit system owned by the City of New York and leased to the New York City Transit Authority, a subsidiary agency of the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).

Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Luca Di Angelo (Fabio Testi) is a smuggler, one member of an organized team trafficking cigarettes and booze up and down the coast off Naples, Italy. After a run-in with the police in which the smugglers manage to get away by faking a boat explosion resulting in the police motorboats responding to the false emergency allowing the smugglers to get away, Luca and his brother Mickey suspect Scherino (Ferdinand Murolo), the head of a rival gang of smugglers, of passing on their actives. Lucia and Mickey take their accusations to their boss Perlante (Saverio Marconi) a sleazy playboy withy numerous Mafia connections, who agrees to look into it. After a nighttime fire at Mickey's racing stables kills a valued racehorse, he and Luca drive over to inspect the damage. But on the way, they are stopped at a fake police roadblock where the assassins dressed as policemen trick Mickey into getting out of the car and machine-gun him to death over and over again (a homage to Sonny Corelone's death scene in The Godfather), while Luca barely escapes injury by hiding on the floor of the car.Afterwards, Perlante suggests that Luca leave town for a few days, but he refuses. After his brother's funeral, conducted on the gang's speedboats in the Bay of Naples, with the police surveying them, Luca vows revenge. Despite his wife Adele's (Ivana Monti) pleas, Luca goes after the prime suspect: Scherino. That night, Luca breaks into Scherino's house, but gets spotted and severely beaten up by Scherino's henchmen. However, Scherino spares Luca's life. He tells Luca that he had no part in Mickey's killing.After Luca recovers from his injuries thanks to a local doctor named Charlie (Giordano Falzoni) who treats injuries for large bribes of cash, Luca meets with an informant who gives him a tip to who ordered the hit on Mickey. Traveling to a derelict fishing boat in the marina where a hood is making a drug pick-up, Luca tortures him for information about his boss, whom Luca learns is a Frenchman called Francois Jacios, aka: The Marsigliese. Luca calls Perlante, who tells him more about the vicious gangster, and who is muscling into Italian organized crime to deal in hard drugs. At his hideout in Naples, the Marsigliese (Marcel Bozzufi) is meeting Ingrid, a German drug courier from Frankfurt wanting to sell him some heroin. When the Marsigliese sees that the heroin is 'cut', he has her face horribly burned by a blowtorch while he watches with sadistic satisfaction.Over the course of one day, the Marsigliese orders a series of shootings of all the rival Mafia Dons all over Naples as part of his plan to become the sole kingpin of Naples. Perlante barely escapes an attempt on his life when his right-hand man Alfredo (Giulio Farnese) triggers a bomb which has been hidden under Perlante's bed, killing Alfredo and Perlante's mistress. Perlante calls Luca and tells him about the series of hits. He sets up a meeting between them and the Marsigliese at the local soccer stadium where the Frenchman discusses merging their criminal concerns. Afterwards, Luca meets with his fellow smugglers and persuades them not to accept the Marsigliese demands for the inflow of drugs into their community would only escalate the number of addicts and drug-overdoses, plus they would not receive any profits since the Marsigliese would keep most of the money for himself and his close associates.In response to the Mafia killings, the Naples police chief (Fabio Jovine) orders Captain Tarantino (Venantino Verantini) to conduct a massive sweep of the Neapolitan bay area to clean it up of crime. The dragnet has many smugglers arrested. Luca is saved from a police raid on his house by, of all people, Scherino, who suggests they form an alliance to defeat the Marsiglise. They meet that night at Perlante's house to discuss their plans with him. But Luca soon smells the tell-tale odor of the Marsiglieses personal parfum in the room. Luca realizes that Perlante is in league with the Marsgliese just as the gangster and his henchmen burst into the room and kill all of Scherino's henchmen as well as mortally wound Scherino himself. Luca's split-second reflexes of diving out a glass window and running away from the house ensures his escape. The mortally wounded Scherino manages to shoot off one shot from his gun at the treaterous Perlante, hitting him in the neck, before he drops dead himself.The Marsigliese abducts Luca's wife, Adale, and again insists that Luca should turn over the smuggling network over to his drug operation. To help Luca make up his mind, the sound of Adale being beaten and gang-raped are relayed to Luca over the phone. Luca agrees to the Marsigliese demands. In desperation, Luca calls upon the elderly Don Morrone (Guido Alberti), the leader of the old-guard Italian Mafia who has been reading the news throughout the movie of the numerous killings. Morrone is happy to come out of semi-retirement to deal with the French sadist. Morrone relays his plans to his various middle-aged associates who swing back into action for their cause.The following morning, a meeting between Luca and the Marsigliese in a local open square where the handover to Adele is taking place. Luca sees that it is indeed a set up to have him killed. Don Morrone and his men, using a series of hit-and-run attacks, appear and blast away all of the Marsigliese's henchmen. Luca then chases the crazed Marsigliese through the deserted streets and allyways where after the Frenchman runs down an alley which is a dead end, Luca catches up to him and shoots the Marsigliese dead who lands on a pile of garbage bags. Across down, the police raid the Marsigliese hideout where they find the tramatized Adele and a large stash of cocaine and heroin, while the rest of the Marsigliese henchmen surrender.The final scene has Captain Tarantino meeting with Don Morrone and his housekeeper at a wharf marketplace where the policeman thanks the elderly Mafia don for his tip leading to the discovery of the Marsigliese hideout and drug shipment seizure. But when Tarantino asks Morrone about the murder of the Marsigliese and his men, Morrone claims to know nothing about it, and also not to know Luca Di Angelo.

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. Paragraph: Dan studied multicellular organisms that presented mutations. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group had fewer organisms having mutations that can be passed to the next generation? A:","completion":"Group B had fewer organisms having mutations that can be passed to the next generation. This is because, as mentioned in the background information, somatic mutations occur in somatic or body cells and cannot be passed to the offspring. In contrast, germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and have the potential to be passed to the next generation. As a result, organisms in Group A, which presented germline mutations, would have more organisms with mutations that can be inherited by the next generation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood. Considering the unimaginative cuisine of my youth, it's surprising that I eat anything at all. So with dead, smelly fish in mind, I persuaded my friend Shan to pick one up when he was down at the Saturday Farmer's Market. He returned with a four-pound shad, frozen solid.

As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.

Look to see if the water level in the tank has gone up or down.

Identifying and fixing these leaks is essential in maintaining the functionality and sustainability of your household. This article will guide you through a simple and effective method – the dye test – to detect toilet leaks and provide insights on how to address them. Step 1: Turn Off the Water Supply to the Toilet Before starting the dye test, it is important to turn off the water supply to the toilet. This will help ensure that the dye remains in the tank for the required duration and does not get diluted or flushed during the testing process. Locate the shut-off valve, which is typically found on the wall behind or near the toilet, and turn it clockwise to close it. Step 2: Mark the Water Level in the Tank Next, carefully remove the toilet tank cover and set it aside. Using a marker or pencil, make a visible mark on the inside of the tank to indicate the current water level. The mark will serve as a reference point for detecting any changes in the water level during the test. Step 3: Add Coloring or Food Dye to the Water Add a few drops of food coloring or liquid dye to the water in the toilet tank. Choose a color that contrasts with the natural color of the toilet bowl and tank for better visibility during the test. A darker dye color, such as blue or green, is recommended for clear visibility. Mix the dye in the tank water to ensure even distribution. This dyed water will help identify any leaks by observing changes in color within the toilet bowl or tank. Step 4: Wait 10 Minutes Allow the dye to settle for at least 10 minutes. This duration will give the dye enough time to work its way through the toilet system and reveal any possible leaks. During this time, be sure not to use or flush the toilet to ensure accurate results. Step 5: Check the Water in the Toilet Bowl After the 10-minute waiting period, inspect the water in the toilet bowl. If the dyed water has seeped into the bowl, it indicates a possible leak in the flapper valve or toilet gasket. The flapper valve prevents water from flowing from the tank to the bowl when the toilet is not in use, and a dysfunctional flapper valve can cause constant water leakage into the bowl. Step 6: Look for Changes in the Water Level in the Tank Compare the current water level in the tank to the mark you made earlier. If the water level has dropped below the marked line, it is an indication that there is a leak within the toilet tank. The culprit may be a cracked tank or faulty fill valve. Step 7: Check for Dyed Water Leaks on the Floor Inspect the floor around the base of the toilet for any signs of dyed water. If the dyed water is present on the floor, it may be due to a leak in the wax ring that seals the base of the toilet to the floor or an issue with the fill valve. In some cases, the water may seep between the toilet tank and bowl, which indicates a damaged tank-to-bowl gasket. Conclusion The dye test is an efficient and cost-effective method to detect toilet leaks and identify the source of the problem. By following the steps provided in this guide, you can ensure that your toilet is functioning efficiently and effectively, preventing future costly repairs and water wastage. In case the dye test reveals a leak, it is important to consult with a professional plumber for further assessment and repairs. Maintaining your toilet's functionality and water efficiency not only saves you money but also helps conserve our planet's precious water resources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They collect samples of each for further study and load them aboard their C-47 military transport. The dull, workaday life at the Navy weather station base on Gow Island in the South Pacific is interrupted by that very same C-47 transport aircraft. On a routine approach for refueling, the transport experiences unusual trouble and suddenly crash lands on the island's single airstrip, destroying its control tower and the island's only two-way radio. The stricken aircraft also blocks the runway, preventing its further use. Lieutenant Charles Brown (Eisley) is in command of Gow's weather station. He, Navy nurse Nora Hall (Van Doren), and biologist Arthur Beecham (Walter Sande) reach the wreck only to find that seven scientists and crew aboard the cargo aircraft when it left Antarctica are now mysteriously missing. The only one found aboard is the transport's pilot, who is traumatized and in a state of shock, unable to speak. Unloading the prehistoric cargo from the crashed C-47, Dr. Beecham recommends planting the trees to ensure their survival in the island's tropical conditions. Somewhat later, Gow Island's bird population becomes disturbed by something unknown. At the same time, the weather station's scientists try to figure out a connection between this event and a corrosive residue that begins turning up at various island locations. It slowly becomes clear that the planted prehistoric trees have quickly grown into acid-secreting, carnivorous monsters that move about Gow Island at night, at will. They reproduce fast and eventually cut off the island with their growing numbers and nocturnal assaults on Gow's native islanders.

Please answer this question: where is calcium stored in a muscle cell?","completion":"Calcium is essential for various cellular functions, including muscle contraction. In a muscle cell, also known as a myocyte, calcium is primarily stored in a specialized organelle called the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The SR is an extensive network of interconnected tubules and cisternae, which are membrane-bound compartments. These specialized compartments are responsible for the calcium storage and regulation functions within the muscle cell. The sarcoplasmic reticulum envelops myofibrils, the long, cylindrical structures within the muscle cell that are responsible for muscle contraction. The SR is particularly abundant in fast-contracting muscle fibers, which rely heavily on rapid calcium release and reuptake for optimal function. Within the SR, calcium ions (Ca2+) bind to a protein called calsequestrin. Calsequestrin has a high capacity for calcium binding, allowing it to store large quantities of calcium ions. This calcium reservoir within the SR remains ready for release when the muscle cell receives a contraction signal from a motor neuron. When a muscle cell is stimulated to contract, an action potential travels along the sarcolemma, the cell membrane of the muscle cell, and into the transverse (T) tubules. T-tubules are invaginations in the sarcolemma that penetrate deep into the muscle cell, allowing the action potential to quickly reach the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The action potential activates voltage-gated calcium channels on the T-tubules called dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs), which in turn activate ryanodine receptors (RyRs) on the SR membrane. The RyRs function as calcium-release channels, permitting the release of stored calcium ions from the SR into the sarcoplasm. The freed calcium ions then bind to troponin, a regulatory protein within the muscle cell's contractile machinery. This binding causes a conformational change in tropomyosin, another regulatory protein, which exposes myosin-binding sites on actin filaments. Myosin, a motor protein, utilizes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to generate force by binding to actin and producing a power stroke motion, causing the muscle cell to contract. After the contraction, the calcium ions are pumped back into the SR through the action of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), an ATP-driven calcium pump. The reuptake of calcium ions into the SR lowers the calcium concentration in the sarcoplasm, causing the muscle cell to relax. In summary, calcium is mainly stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum within a muscle cell, where it is bound to calsequestrin. During muscle contraction, the stored calcium ions are released into the sarcoplasm, initiating a series of events that ultimately lead to muscle contraction. After the contraction, calcium ions are actively transported back into the SR, allowing the muscle cell to relax."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer: Answer:","completion":"Based on the given review, it can be inferred that the user would likely recommend the product, which in this case is the album 'Den of Inequity' by Norman Haines. There are several aspects of the review that support this conclusion: 1. The comparison to Locomotive's album 'We Are Everything You See' and the mention of both albums being organ-based, slightly psychedelic rock indicates that the user is familiar with and appreciates this genre of music. By drawing this connection, the user shows a positive association with both the artist and the style of music. 2. Additionally, the description of the music as \\"dynamic art-psych\\" suggests that the user views the album as a successful and engaging example of this sub-genre of rock music. By using the phrase \\"you can't go wrong,\\" the user implies that this album is a solid choice for those interested in this type of music. 3. While the user does mention that the singer's voice is \\"not that strong,\\" this observation is immediately followed up by stating that it \\"works well against the big backdrop of the music.\\" This suggests that, while the vocals may not be perfect, they are suitable for the overall sound of the album and do not detract from the user's enjoyment of it. 4. Finally, it is worth noting that, although the user acknowledges that 'Den of Inequity' is \\"not the most original album,\\" they do not elaborate on this point or present it as a significant drawback. Instead, they focus on the positive elements of the album, stating that it is a good choice for fans of art-psych rock. In summary, based on the user's review of 'Den of Inequity' by Norman Haines, it is reasonable to conclude that they would recommend the album to others, particularly to those who enjoy organ-based psychedelic rock reminiscent of the early 1970s."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In fact, it is quite the opposite. John Gilbert rose to fame during the silent film era, meaning that a significant portion, if not the entirety, of his acting career took place before the widespread use of synchronized sound in films. Silent films relied on visual storytelling, and actors like Gilbert had to convey emotions mostly through body language, facial expressions, and other nonverbal cues. The paragraph mentions that Gilbert was a popular leading man known as \\"The Great Lover\\" and even rivaled Rudolph Valentino, another silent film star, in box-office success.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: When did Nine Inch Nails return to touring after its lead singer decided to cease touring with the band? , can you please find it? Nine Inch Nails, an industrial rock band fronted by Trent Reznor, has toured all over the world since its creation in 1988. While Reznor—the only official member until adding Atticus Ross in 2016—controls its creative and musical direction in the studio, the touring band performs different arrangements of the songs. In addition to regular concerts, the band has performed in both supporting and headlining roles at festivals such as Woodstock '94, Lollapalooza 1991 and 2008, and many other one-off performances including the MTV Video Music Awards. Prior to their 2013 tour, the band had played 938 gigs.Nine Inch Nails' live performances contrast with its in-studio counterpart. Reznor writes and performs nearly all Nine Inch Nails studio material, with occasional instrumental and vocal contributions from others artists. However, Reznor has typically assembled groups of backing musicians to interpret songs for tours and other live performances. Keyboardist Alessandro Cortini said that \\"if you see the show and you're used to the CDs it's pretty clear that the studio entity is different from the live entity\\".The only constant member of the live band is Reznor. Live Nine Inch Nails performances are typically accompanied by lighting, stage, and video projection effects. Since 1999, the visual design components of live shows have been curated by Reznor with Rob Sheridan. Three tours have been chronicled on live albums and tour documentaries. Critical and commercial response to Nine Inch Nails live performances has generally been positive. Critics have pointed to the concerts' aggressive on-stage dynamic and visual designs as high points.

The CCTV footage shows the man following another woman off Wellington Street on the night of the attack. West Yorkshire Police has appealed on BBC Crimewatch for her to come forward. Detectives said the victim was left with serious head injuries and a fractured pelvis when she was struck over the head numerous times with a large stone before being raped at about 22:30 GMT. In a reconstruction on the programme, the victim spoke of her ordeal, which was voiced by an actor. She said: \\"I haven't been able to stop thinking about what happened.

The day is a reminder that we do not need to rely so much on cars. Those who take part in the activity hope that we all should realize we do not have to accept our car-controlled society. Carlos Pardo from Colombia's Sustainable Urban Transport Project said, \\"World Car Free Day is not only a celebration of fun ways to get around the city, but a demonstration of traffic-free streets and clean air is possible. But we do not want just one day of celebration and then a return to normal life. When people get out of their cars, they should stay out of their cars. It is up to us, our cities and our governments to help create lasting change to benefit walkers, cyclists and other people who do not drive cars. \\" Car-free days were organized as early as during the 1970s, and several car-free days were organized in European cities during the early 1990s. An international car-free day was organized in Europe in 1999. The European Union adopted the idea in 2000. Today, as many as 100 million people in over 1500 cities worldwide celebrate this day. World Car Free Day aims to take a large number of cars off the streets for all or part of a day. This will give people a chance to see what their town might look like with fewer cars.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the real name of the person whose father brought home a collection of American 45s?, using the article: Bowie was born David Robert Jones on 8 January 1947 in Brixton, London. His mother, Margaret Mary \\"Peggy\\" (née Burns; 2 October 1913 – 2 April 2001), was born at Shorncliffe Army Camp near Cheriton, Kent. Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester. She worked as a waitress at a cinema in Royal Tunbridge Wells. His father, Haywood Stenton \\"John\\" Jones (21 November 1912 – 5 August 1969), was from Doncaster, and worked as a promotions officer for the children's charity Barnardo's. The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and Stockwell in the south London borough of Lambeth. Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler.In 1953, Bowie moved with his family to Bromley. Two years later, he started attending Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered \\"adequate\\" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the recorder. At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly-introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations \\"vividly artistic\\" and his poise \\"astonishing\\" for a child. The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American 45s by artists including the Teenagers, the Platters, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley, and Little Richard. Upon listening to Little Richard's song \\"Tutti Frutti\\", Bowie would later say that he had \\"heard God\\".Bowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin dance to \\"Hound Dog\\". By the end of the following year, he had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile, his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local Wolf Cub group was described as \\"mesmerizing ... like someone from another..., what would be the answer ?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Communication within peer groups allows adolescents to explore their feelings and identity as well as develop and evaluate their social skills. Peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose peer groups based on characteristics similarly found in themselves. By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent’s own self-concept. Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. Peer groups can have positive influences on an individual, such as on academic motivation and performance. However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure. Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter. Further evidence of peers hindering social development has been found in Spanish teenagers, where emotional (rather than solution-based) reactions to problems and emotional instability have been linked with physical aggression against peers. Both physical and relational aggression are linked to a vast number of enduring psychological difficulties, especially depression, as is social rejection. Because of this, bullied adolescents often develop problems that lead to further victimization. Bullied adolescents are both more likely to continued to be bullied and to bully others in the future. However, this relationship is less stable in cases of cyberbullying, a relatively new issue among adolescents.

Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield. and the situation: Two farms were testing new methods to increase production.

Write some highlights for the following article: The first child in Britain known to have been screened as an embryo to ensure she did not carry a cancer gene was born Friday, a spokesman for University College London told CNN. Genetic screening allows lab-fertilized embryos to be tested for genes likely to lead to later health problems. Her embryo was screened in a lab days after conception to check for the BRCA-1 gene, linked to breast and ovarian cancer. People with the gene are known to have a 50-80 percent chance of developing breast or ovarian cancer in their lifetimes. British newspapers have dubbed the girl the \\"cancer-free\\" baby. \\"This little girl will not face the specter of developing this genetic form of breast cancer or ovarian cancer in her adult life,\\" said Paul Serhal, a consultant at University College London Hospital and Medical Director of the Assisted Conception Unit. \\"The parents will have been spared the risk of inflicting this disease on their daughter. The lasting legacy is the eradication of the transmission of this form of cancer that has blighted these families for generations.\\" Yet not everyone is thrilled with the idea of testing embryos for genes that could cause health problems later in life, a process known as preimplanatation genetic diagnosis. \\"This is not a cure for breast cancer,\\" said Josephine Quintavalle, co-founder of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, which describes itself as group that focuses on ethical dilemmas related to reproduction. What do you think about testing embryos for gene defects? \\"This is simply a mechanism for eliminating the birth of anybody (prone to) the disease,\\" she said. \\"It is basically a search-and-kill mechanism.\\" She opposes the procedure because embryos found to carry disease-causing genes often are discarded. She says that is essentially murder. \\"They will be destroyed,\\" she said. \\"They will never be allowed to live.\\" Doctors in Britain and elsewhere increasingly test embryos for genes that are certain to cause illnesses such as cystic fibrosis or Huntington's Disease. What's different about the girl born Friday is that she is the first infant known to have been tested in Britain as an embryo for a gene that is merely likely -- not certain -- to cause disease. In the United States, geneticists are free to test for any condition for which they can develop a probe -- and they're free to look for genes that are certain to cause diseases as well as genes that merely may pose problems later in life. Quintavalle opposes any form of in-vitro fertilization where embryos are \\"killed,\\" she said. But she is particularly troubled by the idea of screening an embryo for the BRCA-1 gene because carriers of the gene do not always develop the disease, and the disease is not always fatal. \\"The message we are sending is: 'Better off dead than carrying (a gene linked to) breast cancer,'\\" she said. \\"We have gone very much down the proverbial slippery slope.\\" Peter Braude, one of the top British experts on the genetic testing of embryos, said he understands the ethical objections but focuses on the benefits. \\"There has always been a vociferous group in opposition,\\" he said. But \\"there are people who can benefit and I think they should be allowed to do so.\\" In fact, he argues that the procedure actually prevents abortions because it takes place on a three-day old embryo in a lab. Only embryos that lack the defective gene are implanted. \\"I don't think you can equate eight cells in a dish to an embryo or a child,\\" said Braude, head of the department of women's health at the King's College London School of Medicine. For many couples, the alternative to testing an embryo is to conceive a child naturally and test the fetus weeks or months into a pregnancy. Some couples opt for an abortion when such testing reveals a defect. Diagnosing an embryo genetically typically involves fertilizing an egg with a sperm in a lab, testing the resulting embryo and implanting it in the mother if no defects are found. Braude agrees that testing for diseases that may not be fatal -- or may not manifest themselves for decades -- raises thorny ethical questions. \\"How serious does it have to be before you throw away an embryo?\\" he asked. \\"Are you prepared to throw away a 16-week embryo for Huntington's, which will not manifest until age 40?\\" In Britain, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority determines the conditions for which geneticists can test. It has approved testing for more than 60 conditions since it was established in 1990. The authority approved testing for the BRCA-1 gene in 2008. Dr. Mark Hughes, who founded a genetics clinic in the United States, said he likes the idea of an authority that regulates what tests can be performed -- the system in place in Britain -- but believes that parents who want to test for genetic abnormalities should be allowed to do so. At his Genesis Genetics Institute in Detroit, Michigan, Hughes carries out about two tests a month for BRCA-1 or BRCA-2, a related gene. \\"The couple is the best one to be making these decisions, because they live with these diseases,\\" he said. \\"When it hits your family over and over again, many couples are saying: 'Enough of this. Let's prune this out of our family tree forever.'\\" He rejects the notion that parents will use genetic testing to remove all imperfections from children. \\"You can get up on your high horse and say people are looking for perfect children, but let's give these families more credit,\\" he said. \\"They just want one that has a fighting chance of not having a disease.\\" Hughes said he doubts genetic screening will ever be used to test all babies. That's partly because it costs the equivalent of about 11,755 -- 8,000 British pounds -- to screen embryos. It's also because the process is very complex. \\"It's gotten easier to do now than it was 19 years ago,\\" when Hughes did his first test for cystic fibrosis, he said. \\"But it has not exploded, not burst onto the medical field like some technologies do. \\"No one would use these technologies for a trivial reason. It's too much effort,\\" he said. \\"Not just the money -- it's so many hoops to jump through for a couple that would prefer to make their baby on vacation rather than in a clinic.\\" Highlights:","completion":"1. A baby girl was born in Britain who was screened as an embryo to make sure she didn't have a cancer gene. 2. The doctors checked her for the BRCA-1 gene, which is linked to breast and ovarian cancer. 3.

Carrie gets her first period, and after becoming distressed, cries out for help. Instead of helping, the other girls ridicule and harass her, throwing out tampons, sanitary towels and toilet paper to her. Teacher Miss Collins (Betty Buckley) rushes in to stop the commotion. White, who appears to be bottling extreme rage, snaps a light bulb. After questioning Carrie, Miss Collins realizes that Carrie is unaware of the concept of menstruation. Because of this, Miss Collins asks the school principal to excuse Carrie from gym class for a week because of the trauma. Upon her way home, Carrie uses her recently discovered telekinesis to stop a boy from teasing her. While at home, Carrie is tormented by her delusional mother (Piper Laurie), who locks Carrie in a closet and forces her to pray--she believes that Carrie received her period due to sinning.Miss Collins, still livid about the incident, berates the other girls and forces them through a detention, deliberately physically exhausting them. The leader of the clique, Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen), refuses to participate, and as punishment, is banned from the upcoming prom. Furious, she blames Carrie for her misfortune. Meanwhile, another one of the girls, Sue Snell (Amy Irving), feels guilty about her part in teasing Carrie, so she asks her boyfriend, Tommy Ross (William Katt), to take Carrie to the prom.

Her husband Satish (Adil Hussain) and daughter Sapna (Navika Kotia) take her for granted, mock her poor English skills and generally treat her with disrespect, making Shashi feel negative and insecure. However, her young son, Sagar (Shivansh Kotia) loves her as she is, and her mother-in-law (Sulabha Deshpande) offers her words of sympathy. Shashi's older sister Manu (Sujatha Kumar), who lives in New York, invites Shashi's family to her daughter Meera's (Neeju Sodhi) wedding to Kevin (Ross Nathan). It is decided that Shashi will go to New York alone to help Manu organize the wedding, and her husband and children will join her as the wedding approaches. During her flight to America, Shashi is given inspirational advice by a fellow passenger (Amitabh Bachchan in Hindi/Ajith Kumar in Tamil). While Shashi is in New York, she has a traumatic experience at a coffee shop due to her inability to communicate in English, but is comforted by the shop's French chef Laurent (Mehdi Nebbou).

Next question: what disease does thomas have in the man in the high castle?","completion":"In the Amazon television series, \\"The Man in the High Castle,\\" Thomas Smith (played by Quinn Lord) suffers from a disease called Landouzy-Dejerine Syndrome. This affliction is a form of muscular dystrophy, more specifically called facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). FSHD is a genetic disorder that leads to progressive weakness and atrophy of the muscles in the face, shoulders, and upper arms. The onset of FSHD symptoms typically begins during adolescence or early adulthood, although the severity and progression of the condition can vary significantly among individuals. As the disease advances, it can lead to difficulty in facial expressions, lifting objects, and even performing daily tasks. Over time, affected individuals may experience difficulty swallowing, speaking, or even breathing. Landouzy-Dejerine Syndrome is caused by a genetic mutation on chromosome 4. It is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, which means that an affected individual has a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to each of their children. In the context of \\"The Man in the High Castle,\\" the disease plays a significant role in the overall storyline and impacts the character's life in various ways. The series is set in an alternate history where the Axis Powers (Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan) won World War II, resulting in a totalitarian regime that values genetic purity above all else. Thomas Smith, son of John Smith (an important character in the show), hides his condition from the authorities, as it is seen as a genetic defect that could lead to extermination under the eugenic policies of the Nazi regime. The struggle to conceal his illness highlights the danger associated with any deviation from the Nazi ideal of \\"perfection\\" and adds emotional depth to the story. It emphasizes the extreme measures individuals were forced to take to ensure their survival in a dystopian world guided and controlled by ruthless and inhumane ideologies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plant plankton, like all photosynthetic organisms, uses sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen through a process called photosynthesis. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of photosynthesis: 1. Plant plankton absorb sunlight (specifically, photons) through their pigments, such as chlorophyll. 2. This absorbed energy allows the plant plankton to convert water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. 3. The hydrogen is then used to reduce carbon dioxide into glucose, which serves as the plant plankton's food source and can be stored or used for energy. 4. Oxygen is released as a byproduct of this process. Since plant plankton needs sunlight to make food and glucose results from the process of photosynthesis, we can conclude that the answer to what plant plankton need for food is: A: Sunlight"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

În primul rând, trebuie să abordăm problema contextului crizei financiare la nivel mondial, în special în ceea ce privește zona euro. Criza a avut un impact semnificativ asupra multor economii europene, cu efecte dramatice asupra nivelurilor de creștere economică, ocupării forței de muncă și stabilității financiare. În acest cadru, moneda comună europeană, euro, a fost pusă sub presiune și a devenit problematică din cauza discrepanțelor economice și fiscale dintre statele membre. Cu toate acestea, în ciuda acestor provocări, euro a rămas relativ stabil în comparație cu alte valute importante, precum dolarul american. Rata de schimb dintre euro și dolarul american a fluctuat în timpul crizei, dar, în general, a rămas în jurul valorii de 1,30. Această stabilitate în fața dificultăților economice evidențiază avantajele unei monede comune într-o perioadă de incertitudine globală, deoarece permite cooperare și coordonare între statele implicate. Pe lângă cooperarea la nivel de politici monetare și controlul inflației, moneda comună facilitează și schimburile comerciale între țările din zona euro. Acest lucru poate ajuta la stimularea creșterii economice, deoarece companiile au acces la piețe mai mari fără necesitatea de a se confrunta cu riscurile fluctuației valutare și cu costurile tranzacțiilor. Această stabilitate nu poate fi, însă, garantată în mod absolut, deoarece există multe factori externi - cum ar fi volatilitatea piețelor financiare internaționale sau politica fiscală și bugetară a statelor membre - care pot afecta valoarea și percepția euro pe termen lung. Prin urmare, este esențial ca statele membre să acționeze într-un mod responsabil și să își îmbunătățească competitivitatea economică pentru a susține pe termen lung moneda comună și simultan să își consolideze instrumentele de gestionare a crizelor și mecanismele de solidaritate financiară. În concluzie, în ciuda crizei care afectează multe economii europene și a discrepanțelor dintre statele membre, euro se menține stabil, cu rata sa de schimb față de dolarul american rămânând în jurul valorii de 1,30. Cu toate acestea, este important ca statele membre să continue să promoveze politici economice solide și să coopereze pentru a proteja și consolida moneda comună în fața provocărilor viitoare."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How can I quickly locate the most upvoted answer to a Quora question? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"These two questions are related, but not inquiring about the exact same information. The first question is about if you should read all the answers before upvoting the most upvoted answer on Quora. The second question is focused on finding a quick way to locate the most upvoted answer on the website. Firstly, to address the question regarding whether to read all answers before upvoting the most upvoted answer for a question in Quora: It is a good practice to read multiple answers to a question on Quora before upvoting any answer. There are several reasons for this: 1. Diversity of opinions: Reading multiple answers allows you to understand different perspectives and opinions from various users. This helps in broadening your knowledge about the topic, as different people may come from diverse backgrounds and experiences, leading to a richer understanding of the subject. 2. Accuracy and completeness: Reading all or at least a significant number of answers allows you to evaluate the accuracy, depth, and completeness of the information provided. The most upvoted answer might not always be the best or the most accurate one. You should evaluate answers based on the quality of their content and the credibility of their sources. 3. Fairness: Upvoting without reading other answers might lead to an unfair advantage for popular or early answers. New or less popular answers might offer valuable insights but might go unnoticed if users upvote the most upvoted answer without considering others. Now, to address the second question: How can you quickly locate the most upvoted answer to a Quora question? 1. Browse the top answers: Quora typically displays answers based on their upvotes and relevance. So, the most upvoted answer often appears at the top or near the top of the answer list. However, you should still take a moment to scroll through the other answers to verify if the top answer is indeed the most upvoted one. 2. Sort by upvotes: If you want to display answers strictly in the order of the number of upvotes, you can do so by clicking on the \\"Sort by\\" button at the top right corner of the answer list. After clicking on the \\"Sort by\\" button, select \\"Upvotes\\" from the dropdown menu. The answers will then be arranged according to the number of upvotes they have received, with the most upvoted answer being at the top. In summary, while these two questions are related, they are asking different things. The first question promotes a thoughtful consideration of all answers, while the second provides a way to quickly locate the most popular answer. When using Quora, it is beneficial to read multiple answers to gain various perspectives and ensure you're upvoting the most accurate and comprehensive response."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English English:","completion":"The global economic crisis will most likely only exacerbate the already deplorable situation in which these people find themselves. In recent years, the world has witnessed several economic crises affecting various regions and impacting people's lives in numerous ways. Individuals, businesses, and governments all experience the adverse consequences of economic downturns. In this particular context, the statement highlights how the global economic crisis is likely to intensify the difficulties faced by a specific group of people who are already struggling. It is essential to analyze the different aspects and reasons through which an economic crisis might worsen the living conditions of those suffering. Furthermore, understanding the potential strategies and possible solutions to tackle these crises can help mitigate their negative impact on vulnerable populations. 1) Unemployment: Economic crises often lead to job losses and reduced work hours across industries. The higher the unemployment rate, the more significant the financial stress individuals and families experience. People who were already struggling to make ends meet before the crisis may find themselves in even more dire straits as they lose their sources of income amidst the economic turmoil. 2) Decreased government spending: Governments typically face budget constraints during economic downturns, resulting in decreased spending on social welfare programs. This directly affects the support available to disadvantaged individuals, including healthcare, education, and unemployment benefits. With reduced governmental assistance, these people become particularly vulnerable to the devastating effects of a floundering economy. 3) Inflation: Inflation often ensues during economic crises as currency values may decrease, triggering price hikes on essential goods and services. These increased costs are especially burdensome for low-income families and individuals who may no longer afford necessities like food, housing, and healthcare. 4) Poverty: The combined consequences of unemployment, reduced government spending, and inflation can escalate the poverty rate. As more people slide below the poverty line, social inequalities and disparities widen. Those who were already struggling before a crisis are at the highest risk of falling deeper into poverty, leading to more significant hardships. 5) Mental health issues: Economic crises also impact mental health, as the stress and financial uncertainties that accompany them can contribute to anxiety, depression, and other psychological disorders. The lack of access to mental healthcare and support, particularly among vulnerable populations, exacerbates these issues. To mitigate the detrimental effects of an economic crisis, governments and organizations must implement policies and provide support for vulnerable populations. These measures may include increased funding for social welfare programs, unemployment benefits, job creation projects, and financial assistance for small businesses. Additionally, investing in education and healthcare can further contribute to the economic recovery and ensure that all citizens have access to essential services. In conclusion, the global economic crisis indeed threatens to exacerbate the already difficult circumstances faced by some people. Recognizing these impacts and understanding the need for increased support can help provide a foundation for recovery efforts and alleviate the suffering of those most vulnerable to the consequences of a faltering economy."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Write highlights for this article: By. Robert Hardman. PUBLISHED:. 20:56 EST, 3 January 2014. |. UPDATED:. 10:09 EST, 4 January 2014. Serenaded by a jazz band, a chapter of Hell’s Angels, his family and more old geezers than on the Old Kent Road, Ronnie Biggs made his last escape yesterday afternoon — to the hereafter. His wicker coffin draped in the flags of Britain and his adopted Brazil, the best-known — if least important — of the Great Train Robbers was almost a figure of suburban respectability as he took his final bow in the same North London crematorium as Sigmund Freud, George Bernard Shaw and the Maharaja of Cooch-Behar. But here, too, were all the trappings of a traditional gangland funeral — minus the horse-drawn hearse and gold knuckledusters. Scroll down for video. The Great Train Robber's coffin, draped with a Union Flag, a Brazilian flag and a scarf of his beloved Arsenal football team is carried into Golders Green Crematorium. Tribute: Biggs's granddaughter Ingrid and son Michael speak during the funeral service. Guests had been respectfully asked not to dress in black or wear ‘aggressive or offensive jewellery’. How thoughtful. The rules did not seem to apply to floral tributes, though. One mourner had sent one in the shape of Biggs’s trademark V-sign. Shakespeare. and the poems of Biggs the bard himself were liberally quoted in a. service that drew large numbers of shaven-headed men in leather coats. and a few hard-smoking women. How. many actually knew the man? One of the Hell’s Angels cheerfully. admitted he was just a ‘hanger on’, but said he was glad to be part of. it all. There was also a smattering of celebrities from showbusiness and. the criminocracy. Actor. Steven Berkoff arrived late — ‘the traffic was murder’ he told a. congregation not unfamiliar with the real thing — to deliver his. reflections on ‘a modern-day Ulysses’. Drug. smuggler-turned-author Howard Marks saluted ‘a man of great nobility’ while admitting he had never actually met Biggs in person. Celebrity. ex-gangster Dave Courtney arrived bearing a floral display in the shape. of a train and the succinct inscription ‘Gutted’. In loving memory: A copy of the order of service for the funeral of Ronnie Biggs. Send off: The Hells Angels bikers arrive at the funeral, leading the coffin to the crematorium. Armed. robber and certified madman Charles Bronson also sent a bouquet from. prison and a separate message that was read out during the service:. ‘Ronnie was an icon, a man’s man. Max respect to a diamond geezer.’ There. was a lot of this sort of stuff all afternoon and on into the night as. the mourners grew increasingly lachrymose at a boozer on the Finchley. Road. Also represented was. another strand of London criminal folklore in the form of Freddie ‘Brown. Bread’ Foreman, erstwhile henchman of the Kray twins. But. for all the clapped-out tough guy posturing and half-hearted clenched. fist salutes, the most genuine moment of the day was when Biggs’s son,. Michael, delivered a moving eulogy to the father who had, for many. years, raised him as a single parent in Rio. Acknowledging. that Biggs the villain had been a ‘petty crook who never had any real. success’, he spoke emotionally of the jazz-loving, samba-dancing,. Arsenal-mad champion of the underdog who became ‘my dad, my mum, my. entire family’. Tribute: A six-piece Dixie band joined the procession for the final part of the journey to the crematorium.Leading the hearse and funeral cars, it played songs including When the Saints Come Marching In. Defiance: Ronnie Biggs, seen last year when he made his final public appearance (left), gives a two-fingered salute. He was involved in the Great Train Robbery when he was much younger (right) in 1963. Michael was. the product of Biggs’s affair with a Brazilian dancer after he had fled. to Rio from Australia when his cover was blown in 1970. His. first wife, the devoted Charmian, remained in Australia with their two. surviving sons (another boy, Nicky, died in a car accident). She. still lives there, still bears his name and had sent her own recording. of Shakespeare’s sonnet — ‘Let me not to the marriage of true minds. Admit. impediments ...’ This was more than goodbye to a famous ex-con. This. was a farewell to that black-and-white world of old-style cops and. robbers, of ‘Slipper of the Yard’ and ‘Buster’ Edwards, of bygone heists. planned in smoke-filled pubs and exhaustively chronicled by Fleet. Street for the benefit of a more innocent world. The. Great Train Robbery remains the last criminal showstopper of modern. times which did not involve guns, knives, death, sex or drugs. The. 30-year sentence Biggs received would be inconceivable now. Final sendoff: Draped in both a British flag and a Brazilian flag - in honour of the South American country where he spent so many years on the run - Ronnie Biggs' coffin is taken to his funeral. Hells Angels: The bikers went in front of the funeral cortege as the coffin was driven to the crematorium. Tribute act: The bikers arrive at Ronnie Biggs' family's home in Barnet, north London, to make the journey to the crematorium. For. all the sentimental tosh spoken about it yesterday, however, it was no. Ealing comedy. Train driver Jack Mills received a savage beating and. many of those involved were never the same again. Biggs. was not a key member of the gang that seized more than £2.6 million. from the Glasgow-to- London mail train in August 1963. His job had merely been to supply a bent train driver to replace Mills (in the end, Biggs’s man was not even up to the task). Biggs himself once likened his role to that of ‘teaboy’. His. notoriety and enduring celebrity followed his escape from Wandsworth. Prison to Australia and, latterly, Brazil, where he spent 31 years. raising his proverbial two fingers to British justice. Even after returning home in 2001, upon which he was immediately imprisoned, his attitude was much the same. Short. of cash and laid low by three strokes, he threw himself at the mercy of. the NHS and the British taxpayer, pleading: ‘I am a sick man. My last. wish is to walk into a Margate pub as an Englishman and buy a pint of. bitter.’ Defiant to the last: Thief Ronnie Biggs swears at photographers at the funeral of fellow Great Train Robber Bruce Reynolds last year. Living it up: Ronnie Biggs relaxes in Brazil in 1997 where he spent 36 years on the run from British justice before returning to get medical care. Notorious: Ronnie Biggs, who died last month, revelled in the fame his heinous crime brought him. In 2009, Britain was taken for another ride when Biggs was released from prison in the belief that he was about to die. Two. years later, he was still well enough to say that he was ‘proud’ to. have been one of the robbers, adding: ‘I would do it all again without. the slightest hesitation!’ Nine. months ago, hunched in a wheelchair at the funeral of gang leader Bruce. Reynolds, Biggs raised another two-fingered salute at the media. Yet. it was the media whom Biggs had to thank for the one thing that kept. the money rolling in long after his stolen loot ran out: the legend of. Ronnie Biggs. Yesterday, that legend came to an end, far from the dancing girls of the Copacabana, in Golders Green crematorium. As his son admitted fondly, the old rogue had not even left enough money to cover last night’s bar bill.","completion":"The article by Robert Hardman memorializes the controversial figure of Ronnie Biggs, one of the renown yet least consequential members of the Great Train Robbers. His funeral was held in North London, attracting a motley crowd of relatives, Hell's Angels bikers, celebrities, and fans of criminal folklore. The display had all the characteristics of a traditional gangland funeral, with Biggs' coffin draped in both the British and Brazilian flags, representing his country of origin and his final place of refuge. Notable mentions at Ronnie Biggs' funeral include actor Steven Berkoff who described Biggs as a 'modern-day Ulysses'. Drug smuggler-turned-author Howard Marks spoke about Biggs as a man of 'great nobility', although Marks admitted that they had never met in person. Celebrity ex-gangster Dave Courtney, in a display of grief, brought along a floral tribute in the shape of a train. As part of the funeral eulogy, Biggs' son, Michael, praised his father's role in his upbringing. After acknowledging his father's criminal past, he lauded Biggs' love for jazz music, samba dancing, and the Arsenal football team. He called him a man who championed the underdog, and, in his own words, referred to him as 'my dad, my mum, my entire family'. The author refers to Biggs' funeral as a send-off to an era of old-style cops and robbers, chronicled by a simpler world, unaccustomed to violent criminal activities. Biggs' role in the Great Train Robbery, an event that did not involve guns, knives, death, sex or drugs, became a notoriety that followed him even after his escape to Australia and Brazil. Despite his reduced role in the actual crime, he became a widely recognized figure, largely for his audacious evasions from justice. In a twist of irony, a penniless and ailing Biggs turned to the British healthcare system to care for him in his twilight years, in spite of him spending 31 years blatantly evading British jurisdiction. Released from imprisonment in 2009 under the assumption that he was nearing the end of his life, Biggs lived for several more years, still reveling in his infamous fame. The article concludes by suggesting that the media was responsible for sustaining the legend of Ronnie Biggs. His death in North London, far from the glamour of Brazil, signaled the end of an era as well as that enduring legend."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: People think of ice cream as an American food. Yet, ice cream really came from Asia. In the late 1200s Marco Polo, the great explorer, is said to have seen rich Asians eating dishes of ice. Camels had brought the ice from distant mountains. Before it was served, the ice had been flavored with fruits. Marco Polo brought this new dish to Italy, In France cooks changed the ice recipe and made ice cream. At first, cooks tried to keep the recipe a secret. They wanted it to be a special dish for rich people. By the late 1700s, though, ice cream was sold throughout Europe and America. Some great Americans loved ice cream. George Washington was the first to buy a special machine for making it. When Thomas Jefferson returned from France, he brought an ice cream recipe home with him. Dolly Madison, wife of President James Madison, also liked ice cream, and she often served it at the White House. Actually, a famous brand of ice cream was even named after her.

Q: Article: New findings show that musical training affects the structure and function of different brain areas, how those areas communicate during the creation of music, and how the brain interprets and combines sensory information. The findings were presented at Neuroscience 2013, the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience and the world's largest source of emerging news about brain science and health. These views suggest potential new roles for musical training including training plasticity in the brain, offering an alternative tool in education, and treating a range of learning disabilities. Today's new findings show that long-term high level musical training has a broader effect. Researchers found that musicians have a better ability to combine sensory information from hearing, touch, and sight. The age at which musical training begins influenced brain structure and its function. Beginning training before the age of seven has the greatest effect. Even older adults who took music lessons as children but haven't actively played an instrument in decades have a faster brain response to a speech sound than those who never played an instrument, according to a study appearing November 6 in the Journal of Neuroscience. The finding suggests early musical training has a lasting, positive effect on how the brain deals with sound. \\"Playing a musical instrument is a multi-sensory and motive experience that creates emotions and movements--from finger tapping to dancing -- and engages pleasure and reward systems in the brain. It has the potential to affect brain function and structure when done over a long period of time,\\" said Gottfried Schlaug, MD, PhD, of Harvard Medical School, press conference speaker, also an expert on music. \\"As today's findings show, musical training brings about new processes within the brain, at different stages of life, and with a range of effects on creativity, cognition , and learning,\\" he added.

Dolittle claims that he can talk to animals. In a flashback, he explains that he kept so many animals in his home that they created havoc with his human patients, who took their medical needs elsewhere. His sister, who served as his housekeeper, demanded that he dispose of the animals or she would leave; he chose the animals. Polynesia taught him that different animal species can talk to each other, prompting Dolittle to study animal languages so that he could become an animal doctor. While treating a horse, Dolittle's lack of human empathy offends the horse's owner, General Bellowes (Peter Bull). Bellowes' niece, Emma Fairfax (Samantha Eggar), chides Dolittle for his irresponsibility and rudeness to her uncle. Matthew falls in love with her at first sight. After she has gone, Dolittle admits he also finds her attractive. A friend of Dolittle's sends him a rare Pushmi-pullyu, a creature that looks like a llama with a head on each end of its body. Dolittle takes the creature to a nearby circus, where the Pushmi-Pullyu becomes the star attraction. The doctor befriends a circus seal named Sophie who longs to return to her husband at the North Pole. Dolittle disguises her in women's clothing to convey her to the coast, and then throws her into the ocean. Fishermen mistake the seal for a woman, and have Doctor Dolittle arrested on a charge of murder. General Bellowes is the magistrate in his case, but Dolittle proves he can converse with animals by talking with Bellowes' dog.

Biologists say a mysterious fungus is threatening to wipe out some isolated... (Associated Press) NEW HAVEN, Vt. (AP) — Hidden on hillsides in a remote part of western Vermont, a small number of venomous timber rattlesnakes slither among the rocks, but their isolation can't protect them from a mysterious fungus spreading across the eastern half of the country that threatens to wipe them out. In less than a decade, the fungus has been identified in at least nine Eastern states, and although it affects a number of species, it's especially threatening to rattlesnakes that live in small, isolated populations with little genetic diversity, such as those found in Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and New York. In Illinois the malady threatens the eastern massasauga rattlesnake, which was a candidate for the federal endangered species list even before the fungus appeared. Biologists have compared its appearance to the fungus that causes white nose syndrome in bats, which since 2006 has killed millions of the creatures and continues to spread across North America. It's unclear, though, if snake fungal disease, \\"ophidiomyces ophiodiicola\\" was brought to the United States from elsewhere, as was white nose fungus, or if it has always been present in the environment and for some unknown reason is now infecting snakes, biologists say. \\"I think potentially this could overwhelm any conservation effort we could employ to try to protect this last remaining population,\\" said Doug Blodgett, a biologist with the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife who has been studying the state's rattlesnake population for 15 years. \\"We don't have any control over it. It's just completely out there in the wild.\\" Rattlesnakes were once found across much of the country, but habitat loss and efforts by fearful humans to wipe them out reduced their numbers, especially at the northern edges of their range. In New Hampshire, the disease helped halve the population of rattlesnakes — now estimated at several dozen — after it was first spotted in 2006, although it was only afterward that scientists linked the fungus to the decline, officials said. Vermont's population of timber rattlesnakes is down to two locations near Lake Champlain in the western part of the state with an estimated total population of several hundred. An Associated Press reporter was allowed to accompany wildlife officials to a rattlesnake habitat on condition the exact location not be revealed out of concern that too much attention could further threaten them. Blodgett led an hours-long search for some of the elusive creatures until he found a pair hiding in a rocky crevice, though it wasn't clear if they were infected. Later, a healthy single snake was found on the forest floor. The disease can cause crusty scabs and lesions, sometimes on the head. Jeffrey Lorch, a microbiologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, said he's been getting reports of snake fungal disease from all over the eastern United States. Not every location is reporting that the disease is threatening snake populations. \\"It does seem to be a disease that has different effects in different areas,\\" Lorch said. The fungus poses a greater risk to snakes that reproduce slowly, such as rattlesnakes, which can live up to 30 years, experts say. In Illinois every year the disease infects about 15 percent of the population of about 300 of massasauga rattlesnakes, most of which are in Clinton County, with a mortality rate of 80 to 90 percent, said Matt Allender, a wildlife veterinarian and epidemiologist at the University of Illinois who started noticing the fungus in 2011. The mortality rate in infected timber rattlesnakes is estimated between 30 and 70 percent, he said. The fungus' impact on the massasauga is expected to play a part in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's determination on whether to list the snake as endangered, officials said. \\"I think that in populations that have been shrunk due to other mechanisms, such as habitat loss, other environmental changes, those types of things, are more at risk of going extinct from snake fungal disease mainly because it's a smaller population,\\" Allender said. \\"They have less of a buffer to withstand these diseases.\\" Part of the challenge in studying the disease is that snakes, especially venomous varieties, don't get much sympathy from the public, which makes funding studies harder. Snakes are also harder to find than, say, white-nose-infected bats where scientists can go into a cave and see tens of thousands of carcasses, Lorch said. The fungus has been found in all five rattlesnake populations in Massachusetts, but it doesn't appear to have had the high mortality rate reported elsewhere, said Anne Stengle, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Massachusetts who is overseeing a federal grant in nine states to study the fungus. Since the initial hit, the decline in the Granite State's timber rattlesnakes appears to have stabilized and some are reproducing, said New Hampshire Fish and Game Biologist Mike Marchand. \\"I'm at least optimistic that there are animals that are successfully surviving from year to year as well as reproducing,\\" Marchand said. \\"We had a pretty strong dip in the population.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A mysterious fungal disease known as \\"ophidiomyces ophiodiicola\\" is threatening the already dwindling population of venomous timber rattlesnakes in the eastern United States, particularly in Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York.

Life today is much easier than it was hundreds of years ago, but it has brought new problems. One of the biggest is pollution. To pollute means to make things dirty. Pollution comes in many ways. We see it, smell it, drink it and even hear it. Man has been polluting the earth. The more people, the more pollution. Many years ago, the problem was not so serious because there were not so many people. When the land was used up or the river was dirty in a place, men moved to another place. But this is no longer true. Man is now slowly polluting the whole world. Air pollution is still the most serious. It's bad to all living things in the world, but it is not only one kind of pollution. Water pollution kills fish and pollutes drinking water. Noise pollution makes us become angry more easily. Many countries are making rules to fight against pollution. They stop the people from burning coal in houses and factories in the city, and from blowing dirty smoke into the air. The pollution of SO2 is now the most dangerous problem of air pollution. It is mostly caused by heavy traffic. It is certain that if there are fewer people driving, there will be less air pollution. The earth is our home. We must take care of it. That means keeping the land, water and air clean. And we must try to control the growth of population at the same time.

Summarize this article: At a winding-up hearing at the High Court, Orient owner Francesco Becchetti has been given until 12 June to pay off debts or sell the club. The League Two side were the subject of a winding-up petition brought by HM Revenue & Customs over unpaid taxes. Those debts have now been paid, but money is owed to four other creditors. Chief executive Alessandro Angelieri gave the court a statement saying Becchetti would invest £1m to pay off remaining debts in eight to 10 weeks. Adam Michaelson, legal adviser to the Leyton Orient Fans' Trust, told BBC Radio London: \\"It leaves the club in a state of significant uncertainty and frankly mortal danger. \\"In respect of a potential sale, we would call upon Mr Becchetti now to look to sell the club at the earliest possible opportunity and make good on the promise that he's made.\\" In January, Becchetti said he would be willing to consider selling the struggling League Two side, which he bought in 2014. The club's latest set of accounts, from the year ending 30 June 2015, showed the club had debts of £5,512,449 - more than the value of the club's assets of £5.5m. Analysis - Phil Parry, BBC Radio London So, with a sword of Damocles still swinging over their heads, Orient will have to battle on. Mathematically they still have a chance to avoid relegation, although form would suggest that is unlikely. They have eight games left, are seven points from safety and have picked up just three points from the last 24 available. Off the pitch, with outstanding bills yet to be paid, operations at Brisbane Road may be difficult. For example, a company which provides matchday stewards is on the list of creditors, and perhaps the remaining matchday programmes may not return to full size. As we wait to see if the extra £1m investment promised in court materialises, fans will continue to make preparations for all eventualities. The Fans' Trust has already raised more than £100,000 and are planning to keep Leyton Orient alive in some guise, including a possible 'phoenix club'. Meanwhile, all eyes will be peeled to see if talk of a buy-out comes to fruition.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid. Immediately after the end of this text, author: - not enough information - will continue playing on the playground - will tell how Barend killed people - will tell about his lunch A:","completion":"Taking into account the specifics of your request, the continuation of the story will involve us delving back into our playground days, recounting the gradual change in Barend and his descent into becoming a killer. One of our favorite games as children was playing 'Secret Agent'. We transformed from ordinary school kids to superhuman spies, saving the world from the dangerous villains we imagined. The most attractive aspect of this game was the element of danger and thrill it presented us. Little did I know then that this game was a prelude to the gloomy future Barend would end up having. Barend was a creative player, inventing intricate stories of international espionage missions where we had to use cunning tactics to defeat our enemies. He always took things a step further, executing imaginary enemies ruthlessly. As a child, I found it slightly disconcerting, but dismissed it as a product of an overactive imagination. During our teenage years, Barend's love for danger and thrill didn't subside. It only intensified, but this wasn't surprising. Most of our friends were diving headfirst into youthful rebellion; the more outgoing ones picked up skateboarding, surfing, and graffiti, while the more reserved ones like Barend seeped into the deeper corners of the internet, indulging in increasingly graphic and disturbing content. Barend’s first brush with killing wasn’t as dramatic as one might expect. It began with a pet hamster. It accidentally got crushed when Barend was rearranging his room. But the lack of remorse, the curious dissection, and the clandestine burial was what raised the alarms. I felt a creeping sense of discomfort, which only grew when a neighborhood cat mysteriously disappeared shortly after–only to be discovered weeks later in Barend’s backyard, similar clandestine burial. I don’t have a detailed account of each murder Barend committed. We drifted apart when he started delving into the macabre like a moth drawn to a flame. I couldn’t relate to, nor condone, his actions. But as the news unfurled the gruesome details of his misdeeds, I found myself haunted by the memory of the young boy with the fascinating shadow, and burdened with the knowledge that this was the same person. The playground now stands as an eerie reminder of Barend—once an eccentric friend, now a notorious serial killer—and the fading glow of our childhood innocence. Each rusted swing and neglected monkey bar harbors the memories of our naive games, which were once dominated by creativity and shadowed with beautiful innocence, only to be corrupted by the dark cloud of Barend's future endeavors. Lastly, during the interrogation, I recall a peculiar detail associated with Barend. When asked about routine hacking tools or weapons, he instead pointed towards his lunch, a heavily meat-based diet that was always his preference. He said it gave him the strength and the keen sense of death. This disturbing correlation between murderous tendencies and his food habits served as an obscure revelation into the complexity of his criminal mindset. So, that's the journey of how Barend, my playground friend, turned into a dreaded murderer. His shadow, once artwork, now symbolizes a grim silhouette of the horror his acts bestow, forever changing my perception of our past friendship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Story: In a small town blessed with faith and tradition, Tony, a respected member of the local church, was approached by the elders with a delicate matter. They had recently heard troubling news about a notorious artist, who was working on a painting that potentially depicted a blasphemous rendition of the crucifix. The church, fearing the spiritual unrest that could ensue, decided to take action. Fact1: Tony is asked to visit notorious artist out of church 's concern about blasphemous painting of crucifix. They entrusted Tony with the responsibility of visiting the artist and expressing the church's concerns. Hoping to make the artist understand the possible consequences of the blasphemous art, they implored Tony to appeal to his sense of responsibility and judgment. Fact2: The artist plans to exhibit the painting. Upon receiving the task, Tony discovered that the artist was not only working on the painting but also planning to exhibit it in a prominent gallery in the city. He knew he had to act fast before the art would spark a controversy that could tear the community apart. To help him on his mission, Tony asked Estella, a wise and eloquent friend, to accompany him on the visit. She agreed, sensing the urgency of the matter and the potential harm that the painting could cause. Fact3: Estella accompanies him on visit to artist 's bucolic compound in Blue Mountains. The notorious artist lived in a beautiful, secluded compound tucked away in the lush, rolling hills of the Blue Mountains. Upon arrival, Tony and Estella were greeted by the enchanting natural surroundings and the distinct scent of lavender and pine. The artist's home appeared to be a paradise for artistic inspiration. As they made their way through the compound, they came across a bohemian group gathered in an open area, engaged in deep, philosophical discussions. They seemed to be friends or associates of the notorious artist. To Tony and Estella's discomfort, the group freely discussed matters of human sexuality, completely disregarding the limits set by decency and religious beliefs. Fact4: Members of bohemian group frank conversations about participate human sexuality. With determination and a shared sense of duty, Tony and Estella pressed on, trying to find the artist and achieve their goal. As they approached the artist's atelier, they noticed a husband walking nearby, who was clearly flustered and disturbed by the sexual content of the conversations he had just witnessed. Fact5: husband walking nearby is disturbed by scene 's sexual content. Tony and Estella wondered whether the sensibilities of other townspeople would be similarly affected upon encountering such unrestrained discourse about sexuality. They knew their mission was more essential than ever. Eventually, they reached the artist's quarters and presented their case, appealing to the artist's sense of reason and highlighting the importance of respecting community values. They emphasized that art, as a powerful medium, should be used to inspire and uplift rather than to provoke and offend. As the artist listened, he began to understand the gravity of their concerns and the potential impact of his controversial work on others. Realizing that his creativity could create discord in the community, the artist vowed to deal with his painting with more consideration and sensitivity. In the end, Tony and Estella's journey helped them understand the power of communication and empathy, demonstrating that when shared with love and openness, even the most difficult and contentious topics can be addressed with wisdom and understanding. The community remained strong in faith while embracing artists' contributions, finding a delicate balance between creative freedom and communal harmony."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly. Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light. Yet, despite constant interrogations, just two meals of beans a day and a tiny cell with barely enough room to sleep, he says the worst part of prison was not knowing. After what Abduraheem's story, how does he probably feel about being a Christian? A. He now feels that he can be proud and open to being a Christian B. He now feels that his religion doesn't do him any good C. He now still feels reserved and doesn't share openly that he is a Christian D. not enough information Answer:","completion":"A. He now feels that he can be proud and open to being a Christian Hassan Abduraheem's story is a testament to the strength of his faith and his resilience in the face of adversity. Despite facing persecution, imprisonment, and harsh conditions in Sudan, he remained steadfast in his Christian beliefs. Now, having arrived in the United States—a country known for its freedom of religion and speech—the environment is much more conducive for him to openly practice and share his faith with others. The fact that Abduraheem is attending Tar Wallet Baptist Church, openly participating in the hymns, and sharing his own Arabic songs from Sudan, all indicate that he now feels a newfound freedom and pride in being a Christian. Additionally, his journey to the United States—made possible through the help of a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman—may also contribute to his feelings of hope and gratitude, further reinforcing his faith and sense of openness. In this new environment, where his beliefs and rights are protected, Hassan Abduraheem can finally embrace and celebrate his faith without fear of persecution or punishment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: There are many types of meditation, so finding the one that works for you is important. Meditation has been shown to lower blood pressure, lessen anxiety, and much more. If you’re looking for a way to rest without actually sleeping, meditation is a rewarding and mindful way of achieving that goal. Rather than laying on the coaching tossing and turning trying to feel rested, practicing meditation can actively improve your quality of rest. Work breaks into your day before you start to feel exhausted or overtired. If you keep pushing yourself until you actually start to feel awful, it will make it much harder to recover and feel rested. Work breaks into your life on a daily basis, a weekly basis, a monthly basis, and a yearly basis. Everyone needs time to recoup and recharge. This can be as easy as sitting outside for a few minutes before going back to work, taking one day to yourself a week, or a relaxing vacation. We all have a strong habit of discursive thinking, which means one thought flows to the next and then the next. This can be exhausting, and if you practice not thinking you can give your mind a valuable break. Open your senses to what is happening around you and pay attention, but don't think about them. Just experience them. When you find yourself drifting back into a line of thought, notice this and go back to paying attention to what you are experiencing. Sleeping is the one time when we are really able to give our minds a rest. Although meditation can help, sleeping is absolutely necessary to feel rested. Don't sacrifice sleep for other activities because the odds are they won't benefit your well being and happiness nearly as much as those extra hours will. Sounds like running water, birds chirping, and even storms can help you relax and stop stressing about whatever is going through your head. You can find playlists of these online. Other great options include gongs, chimes, or whatever instrumental music you might like. The brain always wants some sort of sensory input , and by supplying these sounds you might be able to let go of the more stressful input that you are supplying.","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of finding the right type of meditation for an individual to achieve rest and relaxation, encourages incorporating regular breaks in daily life, advocates for adequate sleep, and suggests using calming sounds to help the mind let go of stress and achieve a peaceful state."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rockefeller was the second of six children and eldest son born in Richford, New York to con artist William Avery \\"Bill\\" Rockefeller (November 13, 1810 - May 11, 1906) and Eliza Davison (September 12, 1813 - March 28, 1889). His siblings were Lucy (1838-1878), William Jr. (1841-1922), Mary (1843-1925) and twins Franklin (Frank) (1845-1917) and Frances (1845-1847). His father was of English and German descent while his mother was of Scots-Irish descent. Bill was first a lumberman and then a traveling salesman who identified himself as a \\"botanic physician\\" and sold elixirs. In 1859, Rockefeller went into the produce commission business with a partner, Maurice B. Clark, and they raised 4,000 (108,948 in 2017 dollars) in capital. Rockefeller went steadily ahead in business from there, making money each year of his career. While his brother Frank fought in the Civil War, Rockefeller tended his business and hired substitute soldiers. He gave money to the Union cause, as did many rich Northerners who avoided combat. Rockefeller was an abolitionist who voted for President Abraham Lincoln and supported the then-new Republican Party. As he said, \\"God gave me money\\", and he did not apologize for it. He felt at ease and righteous following Methodist preacher John Wesley's dictum, \\"gain all you can, save all you can, and give all you can.\\" At that time, the Federal government was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from .35 a barrel in 1862 to as high as 13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes in the ground and gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water. In this environment of wasteful boom, the partners switched from foodstuffs to oil, building an oil refinery in 1863 in \\"The Flats\\", then Cleveland's burgeoning industrial area. The refinery was directly owned by Andrews, Clark & Company, which was composed of Clark & Rockefeller, chemist Samuel Andrews, and M. B. Clark's two brothers. The commercial oil business was then in its infancy. Whale oil had become too expensive for the masses, and a cheaper, general-purpose lighting fuel was needed. While other refineries would keep the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost 2.50 each ended up only .96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself. In February 1865, in what was later described by oil industry historian Daniel Yergin as a \\"critical\\" action, Rockefeller bought out the Clark brothers for 72,500 (equivalent to 1 million in 2017 dollars) at auction and established the firm of Rockefeller & Andrews. Rockefeller said, \\"It was the day that determined my career.\\" He was well positioned to take advantage of postwar prosperity and the great expansion westward fostered by the growth of railroads and an oil-fueled economy. He borrowed heavily, reinvested profits, adapted rapidly to changing markets, and fielded observers to track the quickly expanding industry.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the province in whose southern areas are found the only extensive agriculture? The province has a saltwater coastline bordering Hudson Bay and more than 110,000 lakes, covering approximately 15.6 percent or 101,593 square kilometres (39,225 sq mi) of its surface area. Manitoba's major lakes are Lake Manitoba, Lake Winnipegosis, and Lake Winnipeg, the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world. Some traditional Native lands and boreal forest on Lake Winnipeg's east side are a proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site.Manitoba is at the centre of the Hudson Bay drainage basin, with a high volume of the water draining into Lake Winnipeg and then north down the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. This basin's rivers reach far west to the mountains, far south into the United States, and east into Ontario. Major watercourses include the Red, Assiniboine, Nelson, Winnipeg, Hayes, Whiteshell and Churchill rivers. Most of Manitoba's inhabited south has developed in the prehistoric bed of Glacial Lake Agassiz. This region, particularly the Red River Valley, is flat and fertile; receding glaciers left hilly and rocky areas throughout the province.Baldy Mountain is the province's highest point at 832 metres (2,730 ft) above sea level, and the Hudson Bay coast is the lowest at sea level. Riding Mountain, the Pembina Hills, Sandilands Provincial Forest, and the Canadian Shield are also upland regions. Much of the province's sparsely inhabited north and east lie on the irregular granite Canadian Shield, including Whiteshell, Atikaki, and Nopiming Provincial Parks.Extensive agriculture is found only in the province's southern areas, although there is grain farming in the Carrot Valley Region (near The Pas). The most common agricultural activity is cattle husbandry (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%). Around 12 percent of Canada's farmland is in Manitoba.

Three weeks after the mission, U.S. President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) attends a diplomatic dinner in Moscow, during which he praises the capture and insists the United States will no longer negotiate with terrorists. Marshall and his entourage, including his wife Grace (Wendy Crewson) and daughter Alice (Liesel Matthews), and several of his Cabinet and advisers, prepare to return to the United States on Air Force One. In addition, a number of members of the press corps have been invited aboard, including Russian terrorists and Radek loyalists disguised as journalists led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman). After takeoff, Secret Service agent Gibbs (Xander Berkeley), who has been a mole, enables Korshunov and his men to obtain weapons and storm the plane, killing many of the other agents and military personnel before taking the civilians hostage. Marshall is raced to an escape pod in the cargo hold while pursued by Korshunov's men but they are too late to capture him as the pod is ejected.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: It means hundreds of people who need a high level of nursing care will have to pay their care home charges in future. It follows revelations by the BBC that people in Scotland who should have been eligible for free care were being charged care home fees. Lawyers have told the BBC that the new proposals could be illegal. People who have certain severe medical conditions which require complex care are entitled to have that care paid by the NHS - even if it is delivered in a nursing home or in the person's own home. This is called \\"NHS continuing healthcare\\" and is in addition to the free personal care which is available to everyone in Scotland. However, last year the BBC revealed that the number of people getting all their care costs paid was falling in Scotland, whereas it was rising in England, in line with an ageing population. Following the BBC's investigation, Health Secretary Alex Neil promised to review the situation and urged anyone who felt they had been unfairly turned down for funding to contact him. That review has now accepted that the system in Scotland is not working. It said existing guidance was \\"no longer appropriate\\", \\"open to interpretation\\" and should be completely revised. It has recommended that no-one in a care home in future should have their care costs paid by the NHS. It said continuing care should only be available in facilities funded and managed by the NHS - hospitals or NHS run nursing homes. The report stated: \\"Only those individuals who are required to live in hospital should be exempted from charges relating to their accommodation. \\"All other individuals, whatever their age or disability should contribute to the funding of accommodation costs, should their financial situation permit.\\" Responding to the review, Mr Neil said: \\"This report makes a number of recommendations for reforming continuing care and putting in place a system which will be applied consistently and transparently by all NHS boards. \\"Where patients are assessed as needing this form of acute long-term care the expert group make clear that the most effective and safe way to deliver this is in a hospital setting. \\"This is welcome clarification and we'll now be working with health boards and Cosla to put in place new guidance to underpin this reform of NHS continuing care. He added: \\"We will now ensure it is applied fairly and equally to all patients across Scotland.\\" New guidance will come into force in April next year. Existing arrangements will remain in place for people who are already in receipt of continuing care. Last year, 1,711 people were receiving the care package - three quarters of whom were in NHS facilities, with the remainder in private nursing homes. Families of those affected told the BBC the report was \\"very disappointing but totally predictable\\"'. Opposition parties have criticised the review's recommendations. Scottish Labour's health spokesman Neil Findlay said: \\"The review will now create a two-tier system. \\"Scots suffering from long-term debilitating conditions after April next year will be worse off than current patients. That simply makes no sense. \\"In fact, in future, patients will be worse off than English patients in similar situations. Unless doctors rule that the patient should be in a hospital, the patient and their family will be liable for the costs.\\" Scottish Liberal Democrat health spokesman Jim Hume said: \\"This is not the outcome that anyone was expecting to the review into continuing care. This is a backwards step which goes against all that the Scottish government has said about spending to save. \\"By removing continuing care costs for people receiving treatment at home for complex care, the Scottish Government is effectively chaining people to a hospital bed when they could be in the community.\\"","completion":"In simple words, many people in Scotland who need a lot of help from nurses will have to pay for their care in the future. This is because the old rules about who gets help paying for care are not clear and are being changed. Some people think these changes are not fair because these people still need lots of help, and their families will have to pay for it.

After busting a human trafficking ring led by Sheriff Wood, Jack Reacher returns to his old military headquarters to meet Major Susan Turner, whom he has been working with during his travels and has become his closest friend – only to learn from Colonel Sam Morgan that Turner has been accused of espionage and detained. Turner's attorney, Colonel Bob Moorcroft, reveals that there is evidence that Turner is involved in the murders of two soldiers in Afghanistan, but Reacher believes she is being framed. Moorcroft also reveals an old acquaintance of Reacher, Candice Dutton, has filed a paternity suit against him, claiming he is the biological father of her 15-year-old daughter, Samantha Dutton. Reacher tries to reach out to Samantha, but she rebuffs him, believing he is after her biological mother due to her past as a prostitute. Moorcroft is later killed by an unknown assassin known as the Hunter. Reacher is framed for Moorcroft's murder and arrested and transported to the prison where Turner is being detained. Two hitmen arrive to kill her, but Reacher neutralizes them, rescues her and they escape to Morgan's house, having deduced he is involved in the conspiracy, to extract information. After they leave, the Hunter, revealed to be working with Morgan, kills Morgan and frames Reacher which he learns about from a friend, Sergeant Leach, when he asks her to investigate a military contractor. Reacher and Turner uncover surveillance pictures of Samantha and surmise she is in danger, arriving at her home to find her foster parents dead and Samantha hiding in the kitchen. Reacher and Turner decide to escort Samantha to Turner's old private school for protection, but discover that she has her mobile phone with her and that the enemy probably knows exactly where they are.

Firstly, we want to get rid of the -54*q and 32*q terms from the right side of the equation. To do this, we will add 54*q to both sides and subtract 32*q from both sides of the equation: -27*q + 54*q - 32*q = -54*q + 32*q - 65 + 54*q - 32*q 2. Simplify both sides of the equation: (-27*q + 54*q - 32*q) = -65 3. Calculate the sum of the terms with q on the left side of the equation: -27*q + 54*q - 32*q = -5*q Now, we have: -5*q = -65 4. To solve for q, we need to isolate q. In order to do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by -5: (-5*q) / (-5) = (-65) / (-5) 5.

Hypothesis: The man is in a shopping mall buying clothes. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"No, the given premise does not support or lead to the hypothesis mentioned. Let's analyze both the premise and the hypothesis to understand why they don't have a logical connection. Premise: A man sits playing his accordion and has a suitcase filled with CDs that he is selling for 15.00. The premise focuses on a man who is playing the accordion and selling CDs at the same time. An accordion is a musical instrument, and the man appears to be a performer, most likely a street or public space performer. He has a suitcase filled with CDs, which could be recordings of his own music or that of others. The fact that he is selling these CDs for 15.00 each further supports the idea that he is engaging in a commercial activity, most likely to earn income or promote his music. Hypothesis: The man is in a shopping mall buying clothes. The hypothesis revolves around the idea that the man is in a shopping mall with the primary objective of buying clothes. Based on the premise, there is no indication or mention of a shopping mall, clothes, or the man's intention to purchase clothing items. With these analyses, it is clear that the premise does not provide any evidence or information to support the hypothesis. The premise primarily focuses on the man being a performer, engaging in a commercial activity by selling CDs, and does not suggest anything about him being in a shopping mall to buy clothes. Given the lack of connection between the premise and the hypothesis, it is not accurate or logical to conclude the hypothesis based on the provided premise. The man could be in a public space, perhaps on a busy sidewalk or in a park, where street performers are usually seen displaying their talents and selling their merchandise. It is essential to have supporting information or evidence that relates the man's activity to being in a shopping mall and buying clothes to arrive at such a hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Reduce your activity level. Sleep more.\\" Article:","completion":"**Title: The Ultimate Guide to a Healthier Lifestyle: Simple Tips for Long-lasting Well-being** As we navigate the complexities of modern life, taking care of our physical, mental, and emotional well-being is of paramount importance. With so many aspects of our lives demanding attention, a simple and practical approach to a healthier lifestyle is key. Thankfully, following a few basic recommendations can make a significant difference. In this article, we will delve into a handful of tips that can help you achieve and maintain a better state of health in the long run. **1. Increase your vegetable consumption to five to nine servings per day** Consuming a variety of vegetables is essential for obtaining the vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants necessary to support your immune system and overall health. Eating five to nine servings of vegetables daily ensures that you are consuming various nutrients to fuel your body. This not only keeps you satiated but also reduces the risk of developing specific diseases and promoting healthy digestion. Experiment with different types of vegetables, and incorporate them into your meals in a myriad of ways to avoid monotony. **2. Opt for lean proteins** Protein plays an essential role in building and repairing tissues, as well as maintaining our energy levels. Lean proteins, such as chicken, turkey, fish, legumes, and low-fat dairy products, provide the necessary nutrients without the excess saturated fats found in high-fat meats. By focusing on lean proteins, you can enjoy the benefits of protein-rich foods while avoiding unnecessary calories and promoting a healthy weight. **3. Consider supplementing with a multivitamin containing vitamin B12 and folate** Although a well-rounded diet should provide us with all the necessary nutrients, supplementation can sometimes be helpful in filling any nutritional gaps. A multivitamin supplement with vitamin B12 and folate can be beneficial for those who struggle to consume adequate amounts of these nutrients through their diet alone. Vitamin B12 is critical for maintaining healthy nerves and blood cells, while folate plays a significant role in DNA synthesis, red blood cell production, and preventing birth defects during pregnancy. **4. Stay hydrated by drinking more water** Water is vital to our health as it aids digestion, circulation, and temperature regulation, among other essential functions. Drinking sufficient water throughout the day can prevent dehydration and its side effects, such as fatigue, dizziness, and headaches. Additionally, proper hydration is known to support skin health. Aim to drink at least 8 glasses of water daily, more if you are physically active or live in a hot climate. **5. Reduce your activity levels if needed** While physical activity is generally a cornerstone of a healthy lifestyle, it is essential to listen to your body's cues. Overexertion can lead to injuries, burnout, and a weakened immune system. It is crucial to strike the right balance between staying active and giving your body the rest it requires to recover appropriately. Adjust your activity levels accordingly, and incorporate rest days as needed. **6. Prioritize sleep** Sleep is often overlooked in our quest for a healthier lifestyle. However, adequate sleep is vital for optimal brain function, physical well-being, and emotional stability. Aim for seven to nine hours of quality sleep each night to ensure your body gets the rest it needs to recover, rejuvenate, and function optimally. In conclusion, adopting a healthier lifestyle is not about drastic changes or rigid diets. Instead, it's about making conscious choices regarding our nutrition, activity levels, and self-care. By incorporating these tips into your daily routine, you can pave the way towards greater well-being and a truly fulfilling life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A:","completion":"Richard Löwenthal was a prominent political scientist born on April 15, 1908, in Berlin, which was then part of the German Empire. His life was dedicated to understanding and analyzing the complex world of politics, particularly focusing on the post-totalitarianism interpretation of Soviet politics. This expertise made him an important figure in political science, as his unique perspective offered significant contributions to the study of the Soviet regime. Löwenthal's early years were spent in Berlin, where he was nurtured in a vibrant and intellectually stimulating environment. As he grew older, his passion for politics and political science drove him to pursue a career in this field, eventually establishing a reputation as an insightful and astute commentator on the pressing issues of his time. One of Löwenthal's most notable accomplishments was his argument for a post-totalitarianism interpretation of Soviet politics. This interpretation emphasized the gradual evolution of the Soviet regime toward a more complex and nuanced political system, rather than remaining a rigid totalitarian structure. This perspective was groundbreaking, as it provided a fresh way to analyze the developments in Soviet politics and contributed to a deeper understanding of the forces and dynamics at play within the USSR. Throughout his illustrious career, Richard Löwenthal was not only a political scientist but also an educator, sharing his knowledge and expertise with others through teaching and mentoring. His influence reached far and wide, inspiring generations of scholars and political analysts to engage in a more nuanced understanding of the political landscape. Sadly, Richard Löwenthal passed away on August 9, 1991, in Berlin, Germany.

Context: I first experienced a loss of sexual desire several years ago, just after I turned 40. For a long time, I thought it was me. I thought maybe it was my age. After reading every book and article I could find on sex, relationships, and marriage, I started to wonder if maybe it wasn’t me. Maybe it was my marriage, maybe it was my husband. I never wanted to be “that woman“. The one that screwed around on her husband. But, I had an affair about six or seven years ago. It didn’t last long. But, that’s when I knew my marriage was over. It wasn’t a lack of sexual desire, it was a lack of desire for my husband. I didn’t want him or the marriage. There was nothing wrong with my sex drive. I told my husband that I’d had an affair. He changed for about a month or so. He was very loving and attentive. But it didn’t last. He loves differently than I need to be loved and it’s just not in him to love me that way. A few months after I ended the affair, I got involved with someone else. I know. I shouldn’t have. I’ve experienced things with this other man that I never thought possible. Felt things I thought were only possible in movies. He’s a romantic. Not flowers or candy or jewellery, but he talks and listens. He hears me. He tries to understand me and give me what I need.

Pavement was an American indie rock band that formed in Stockton, California in 1989. The group mainly consisted of Stephen Malkmus (vocals and guitar), Scott Kannberg (guitar and vocals), Mark Ibold (bass), Steve West (drums) and Bob Nastanovich (percussion and vocals). Initially conceived as a recording project, the band at first avoided press or live performances, while attracting considerable underground attention with their early releases. Gradually evolving into a more polished band, Pavement recorded five full-length albums and nine EPs over the course of their decade-long career, though they disbanded with some acrimony in 1999 as the members moved on to other projects. During the Slanted & Enchanted tour, Gary Young's eccentric behavior increased, and he would stage incidents such as handing out cabbage and mashed potatoes to fans at the door of the venue, doing handstands, drunkenly falling off his drum stool, and running around the venue while the rest of the band was playing. The band only understood how severe Young's drinking problem was after Pavement's first few tours. Malkmus later told Tape Op, \\"We knew that he was like a hippie and kinda flaky, but we didn't know he had such a bad drinking problem. We found out on that tour, because he really got sick from being nervous... That's why I let Bob be in the band...'Keep the beat going if Gary passes out.'\\" In 1993, Malkmus attempted to record some new songs at Young's studio with unsuccessful results. The singer later said, \\"We kind of wanted to not record with him anymore, but we were too nice to fire people or even really talk about it... We tried to record there, but it wasn't sounding good and he didn't have his studio ready and he was also in a drinking funk.\\" At the conclusion of a 1993 tour of Australia, Japan, and Europe, the group held a meeting in a hotel room in Copenhagen during which Malkmus, Kannberg and Ibold remained silent while Nastanovich (Young's best friend at the time) argued with the drummer and informed him that his antics were unnecessary. Young ultimately agreed to leave the band. He was replaced by Steve West, who had been a fellow museum security guard at the Whitney Museum of American Art along with Malkmus and David Berman. West's debut performance was in 1993 at a Drag City festival in Chicago. Also that same year, the band contributed to the AIDS-Benefit Album No Alternative produced by the Red Hot Organization with their song \\"Unseen Power of the Picket Fence\\". Pavement's second album Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain was released in 1994. The record was more indebted to the classic rock tradition than their debut. The single \\"Cut Your Hair\\" was the band's closest brush with the mainstream, and briefly enjoyed airplay on alternative rock radio and MTV. Pavement performed the song on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. The video also aired on \\"Career Day\\", a season five episode of Beavis and Butt-head, who termed it \\"buttwipe music\\" and also wanted the band to \\"try harder.\\" The lyrics from another single from the album, \\"Range Life\\", criticized alternative rock stars The Smashing Pumpkins and the Stone Temple Pilots. Malkmus has insisted over the years that the line is meant to be light-hearted and is sung from the point of view of the aging hippie character in the song. Later live versions of the track had the singer substituting \\"The Spice Girls\\", \\"Counting Crows\\", or others for \\"Stone Temple Pilots\\". In response Smashing Pumpkins leader Billy Corgan threatened to drop his band from their slot headlining the 1994 Lollapalooza Festival if Pavement was allowed to play. Corgan and Malkmus would trade barbs through the press for several years afterwards.

Article: Experts believe that there are about 40,000 different types of jobs in the world. Choosing the right one is a difficult task. \\"Finding a job\\" is not the same as \\"choosing a job\\". Many young people end up in a job that they are not suited to do. \\"Chance\\" may play a more important part than \\"decision\\". So here are a few steps to help you think about jobs. First, it is important to recognize what kind of person you are and what special qualities make you different from everyone else. The most important thing is to know your interests and skills. But the point is that there is a difference between an interest and a skill. If you like art and enjoy looking at pictures, it is an interest. But if you can draw a horse that looks like a horse rather than a big dog, that is a skill. The best job is one that uses your skills in doing something together with your interests. As well as this, it is an advantage if you believe that a particular job is worth doing in the world. To examine your skills and abilities still further, ask yourself this question: in the following three areas--skills with people, skills with information or skills with things -- which are your best skills? After that, the next step is research. To find out as much as possible about different kinds of work, go to the library and read books, magazines and newspapers. Ask your friends about the work they do. If you are interested in banking, it is better to talk to a bank clerk of twenty-four, rather than a bank manager of sixty-four. Do not ask your parents' friends for information. A younger person will be able to describe a normal day at work and tell you about the interesting or boring things when you first start working. Finally, trust your own ideas and your own thinking! It is your own life, so find something that you enjoy doing. Question: The difference between \\"finding a job\\" and \\"choosing a job\\" is that _ . Options: A: finding a job is a decision while choosing a job is a chance B: finding a job is more important than choosing a job C: a job that you find is one that is more suitable for you than one that you choose D: a job that you choose is your decision and is suitable for you while one that you find often isn't The answer to this question is:","completion":"D: a job that you choose is your decision and is suitable for you while one that you find often isn't."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The premise describes two figures (Figure 1 and Figure 2) representing Carbon Emissions (in million metric tons) and SO2 Emissions (in million tons), respectively. However, the information provided does not give us any context about these emissions or their sources. Therefore, it is difficult to establish if there is a relationship between these two figures and the hypothesis. The hypothesis introduces a third figure in the book, but we do not have any details about the content or context of that figure. Without any information about this third figure, we cannot assess its connection to the premise or determine any potential relationships between the figures. A proper analysis would require more information about the content of each figure, the context in which they are presented, and any relevant factors that could help establish connections between the figures. For example, if the third figure presented a graph that directly shows a correlation between Carbon Emissions and SO2 Emissions, we could potentially conclude that an increase in one type of emission results in a corresponding increase in the other type of emission. In that case, if the data in Figure 1 and Figure 2 were true, we might be able to conclude that the hypothesis is true as well. However, as presented, we do not have enough information to draw any clear conclusions.

Please answer the following question: This article: While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate.

Article:","completion":"Title: Missing 30-Year-Old Man Found To Be Part of International Passport Counterfeiting Ring Linked to al Qaeda Introduction: In a shocking revelation, a 30-year-old man, who went missing when police arrested 10 individuals in December, has been found to be a member of an international counterfeiting ring. This alleged ring has been accused of stealing passports in Spain and sending them to Thailand. Once in Thailand, the passports were forged and later distributed to groups with links to terrorist organization al Qaeda. (Step 1: Present the main findings from the given points in a concise and structured manner. The aim is to provide the reader with a clear understanding of the topic at hand.) The Discovery: The man, whose identity has not been released, eluded arrest when the police apprehended the 10 suspects involved in the operation last December. Thanks to the ongoing investigation by the Spanish authorities, he was eventually tracked down and subsequently arrested. Preliminary reports suggest that the accused was a key player in the passport theft ring, which targeted unsuspecting Spanish citizens and stole their passports. (Step 2: Elaborate on the discovery and provide additional context to the given points, such as the anonymous identity of the 30-year-old man and the nature of his role in the counterfeiting ring.) The Modus Operandi: The stolen passports were shipped to Thailand, where they were expertly forged and altered to make them suitable for use by individuals reportedly linked to al Qaeda. The forged passports were then dispatched to various terrorist cells around the globe, enabling these individuals to evade detection and execute their nefarious activities without raising any suspicions. (Step 3: Explain how the stolen passports were used, processed, and distributed as forged documents that facilitated the activities of groups connected to al Qaeda.) International Cooperation: This particular case highlights the importance of international partnerships and intelligence-sharing in combating global terrorism and illegal activities. In a joint effort against criminally-run operations, such as this counterfeiting ring, law enforcement agencies from several countries have been collaborating to track down and dismantle the network, prevent the distribution of forged passports, and apprehend the criminals involved. (Step 4: Emphasize the significance of global cooperation and the role it plays in tackling and eliminating criminal activities that might contribute to terrorism.) Conclusion: This case serves as a stark reminder of the intricate web of illegal activities and networks that support terrorism worldwide. It underscores the urgency in strengthening international security measures and intelligence-sharing in order to thwart terrorists and their facilitators. As countries fight against terrorism and strive to ensure public safety, it has become increasingly important to pay attention to the seemingly innocuous criminal operations that might feed and strengthen larger, more dangerous organizations. (Step 5: Reiterate the main points of the article and provide closing thoughts on the significance of the counterfeiting ring's exposure, highlighting the need for continued vigilance and international cooperation in combatting terrorism.)"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Some people will tell you to wait 3 days before you text someone when you get their number. However, after that much time, they might think you’re not interested. Instead of playing games, text the person as soon as you feel like it. That will show them that you’re already thinking of them, and they may be attracted to your straightforward approach. However, do avoid texting anyone too late at night or too early in the morning. You might wake them up, which they probably won’t appreciate. When you’re talking to your crush, you want them to know how thoughtful and clever you are. Using a lot of abbreviations, acronyms, and internet slang might make you seem unoriginal, and they can make your texts hard to read. Try sticking to regular spelling and correct grammar, instead. Sprinkling a few acronyms into your texts is fine. For instance, “OMG I have to tell you something!” is fine, whereas, “OMG u rnt going 2 believe what I heard” probably isn’t going to win your crush’s heart. Read your texts before you send them to try to catch any typos, as well. When you’re first texting someone you like, don’t weigh them down with all the problems in your life. Instead, keep your texts positive, clever, or funny. That will show your crush that you’re a positive person who’s fun to be around. For instance, you might send your crush jokes, cute stories about your day, or funny memes you come across. Avoid too much sarcasm, since it might not come across the right way in a text. Over time, you can gradually open up to your crush, especially if you see them doing the same thing. When you like someone, it can be tempting to read into every text they send you, looking for any sign of how they feel. However, the best way to know for sure whether your crush likes you is just to spend time talking to them. It will become clear in time, so just relax and have fun, and let things develop naturally. For instance, just because your crush sends you short texts doesn’t necessarily mean they’re mad at you or that they don’t like you. They may just be busy. If you’re constantly sending long blocks of texts and your crush is only sending you back short texts (or not texting you back at all), they’re probably busy, and they might get aggravated if you keep blowing up their phone. You don’t have to send exactly 1 message for every 1 message they send, but do try to keep it to a close ratio. Don’t text the person to ask them why they’re not texting you. That can come across as desperate or pushy. If they’re not answering, give them some space. If your crush is always the one who has to say goodbye first, they might start to feel like you like them more than they like you. Give them a chance to miss you by ending the conversation a little earlier than they expect. If you’re ending the conversation because you have somewhere to go, make sure to mention that so they know you have a busy, well-rounded life! Leave your crush hanging by saying something like, \\"Oh, remind me tomorrow to tell you about my job interview!\\" Summary:","completion":"When texting someone you're interested in, remember to be straightforward and text them when you feel like it, rather than waiting for a certain amount of time to pass. Keep your messages positive, clever, or funny, and avoid using too many abbreviations or internet slang. Don't overanalyze their texts, and give them space if they're not responding promptly. Maintain a balanced conversation and occasionally be the one to end the conversation first, so they have a chance to miss you.

Daher begrüße ich heute die durch Ehrgeiz gekennzeichnete Abstimmung über den Bericht Lucas, der ein ganzes Maßnahmenpaket zur Bekämpfung der Umweltauswirkungen der Luftfahrt vorsieht, unter anderem insbesondere die Abschaffung der Befreiung von der Mehrwertsteuer auf Treibstoff für den Luftverkehr. Translate to English English:","completion":"Today, I welcome the ambitious vote on the Lucas report, which proposes a comprehensive package of measures to combat the environmental impact of aviation, including in particular the abolition of the exemption from value-added tax on aviation fuel. The Lucas report, named after its initiator, addresses the urgent need to mitigate the environmental repercussions of aviation, which has experienced significant growth over recent years. This growth has resulted in notable consequences such as increased greenhouse gas emissions, noise pollution near airports, and threats to biodiversity. To tackle these negative impacts, the Lucas report suggests a broad range of actions that can be implemented by relevant parties, including governments, aviation companies, and regulatory bodies. One key proposal within the report is the abolition of the value-added tax (VAT) exemption on aviation fuel. Currently, aviation fuel is exempt from tax in many countries, which allows the industry to maintain low prices and offers little incentive to reduce consumption or invest in cleaner alternatives. The Lucas report posits that removing this exemption will promote the development of more environmentally friendly fuels and technologies, as well as even out the playing field for other forms of transportation that are subject to taxes on their fuels. In addition to the VAT adjustment on aviation fuel, the Lucas report does not shy away from presenting further impactful measures. These include: 1. The imposition of a tax on frequent flyer programs to deter excessive air travel and encourage more sustainable transportation choices. 2. The implementation of a carbon pricing mechanism for the aviation industry to internalize the cost of emissions and create an incentive for airlines to reduce their carbon footprint. 3. The introduction of tighter emission standards for new aircraft and retrofitting measures for existing fleets to promote greater fuel efficiency and reduce pollution. 4. The allocation of funds for research and development on innovative technologies and alternative fuels with lower environmental impacts. 5. The harmonization of regulations and standards at the international level to ensure more consistent and effective action against aviation's negative environmental consequences across the globe. The ambitious vote on the Lucas report reflects a growing recognition of the urgent need to address the environmental challenges posed by the aviation industry. By adopting a comprehensive package of measures, which includes the abolition of VAT exemption on aviation fuel, the report illustrates a strong commitment to taking positive steps towards a more sustainable and environmentally-conscious future for air transportation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They believe that if we do, we shall be very ill because of all the salt in the water. A doctor called Alain Bombard did not believe this. He thought that people could stay alive by drinking sea water and eating small fish, animals and plants from the sea. On 19 October 1953, he set out in a small boat to cross the Atlantic Ocean . He did not take any food or water with him. Every day Dr. Bombard drank just a little sea water. He also caught fish and they had water in them. He drank this water. He could not cook the fish, so he ate them as they were. He took small plants from the sea, which gave him more food.

Mold grows in the buckets positioned to catch the water. She shrugs it off. Outside her office she has taped up a clear plastic suit, and a sign that reads, \\"All employees must don protective gear before coming in.\\" Such is life in limbo. Nearly a year after Sept. 11, the Legal Aid Society-the lawyers for New York's poor and homeless-remains, well, homeless. The nonprofit has been barred from returning to its 90 Church St. headquarters, across from the World Trade Center site, because of environmental concerns. Legal Aid has uncomfortable company. More than 11,500 New Yorkers continue to work out of temporary space, according to analysis by Manhattan-based real estate brokerage TenantWise.com Inc. and Crain's New York Business. That's 8% of the 137,000 workers who lost their offices or access to them when the Twin Towers collapsed. Legal Aid's 450 displaced attorneys and staffers have spent the past 12 months spread among previously unused spaces-some unused for good reason-in the nonprofit's other offices. It could be another year and a half before they return to their old desks. They have contended with difficult working conditions as demand for Legal Aid's services is on the rise because of Sept. 11 and the deteriorating economy. The civil division is spread among a few boroughs. Their papers and documents, some 20,000 boxes worth, are stuck in a storage facility in Linden, N.J. \\"I am counting the days till we can have all the parts back in one place,\\" says Steven Banks, Legal Aid's associate attorney in chief. In the memories of the exiled workers, the old office has achieved mythical proportions. They say the wood paneling and rugs had the ability to cool emotions and lift spirits. The Legal Aid office on Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights, where 65 displaced workers have cobbled together space amid the faded and scratched walls, looks more like a bargain basement. Question: \\"What happened to some of the displaced Legal aid staff?\\" Answer: \\"Resources have been spread out into previously unused places, some very bad shape\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"Yes, this answer is correct.

Article: The works of Shakespeare and Wordsworth are boosters to the brain and better therapy than some guide books, researchers say this week. Scientists, psychologists and English academics at Liverpool University have found that reading the works of the Bard and other classical writers has a beneficial effect on the mind, catches the reader's attention and triggers moments of self-reflection. Using scanners , they monitored the brain activity of volunteers as they read works by William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, T.S Eliot and others. They then \\"translated\\" the original texts into more \\"straightforward\\", modern language and again monitored the readers' brains as they read the words. Scans showed that the more \\"challenging\\" essays and poetry set off far more electrical activity in the brain than the much plainer versions. Scientists were able to study the brain activity as it responded to each word and record how it was \\"activated\\" as the readers encountered unusual words, surprising phrases or difficult sentence structure. This \\"activation\\" of the mind lasts longer, shifting the brain to a higher speed, encouraging further reading. The research also found that reading poetry, in particular, increases activity in the right hemisphere of the brain, helping the reader to reflect on their own experiences, which they compare with what they have read. This, according to the researchers, meant that the classic works were more useful than guide books. Philip Davis, an English professor believes \\"The research shows the power of literature to shift thinking patterns, to create new thoughts, shapes and connections in the young and adults alike.\\" Question: What is the possible benefit of reading classic works according to the study? Yes or no, is the answer \\"It inspires regular readers to think out of the box.\\"?

Today, the word is still used informally as a social title for men (somewhat like the English word \\"mister\\" and the French word \\"monsieur\\", which literally means \\"my lord\\"). Unlike \\"mister\\" however, it follows the name and is used generally with first names and not with last names. - Anatolia (from Greek , ' \\"east\\" or \\"(sun)rise\\"; in modern ), in geography known as Asia Minor (from ' \\"small Asia\\"; in modern ), Asian Turkey, Anatolian peninsula, or Anatolian plateau, is the westernmost protrusion of Asia, which makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey.

It has been recognized by many historians that she was the daughter of the Anatolian Turkish Bey, \\"Ömer Bey\\", although there had been some speculations that she was the daughter of Sheikh Edebali. Other sources say that she was the daughter of Ömer Abdülaziz Bey, Seljuk vizier of Anatolia. - Erturul (Erorl; often with the title \\"Gazi\\") (died c. 1280) was the father of Osman I, the founder of the Ottoman Empire. While his historicity is proven by coins minted by Osman I which identify Erturul as the name of his father, nothing else is known for certain about his life or activities. According to Ottoman tradition, he was the son of Suleyman Shah, leader of the Kay tribe of Oghuz Turks, who fled from eastern Iran to Anatolia to escape the Mongol Conquests. According to this legend, after the death of his father, Erturul and his followers entered the service of the Seljuks of Rum, for which he was rewarded with dominion over the town of Söüt on the frontier with the Byzantine Empire.

In the Byzantine civil war of 1341 -- 1347 , the regent John VI Kantakouzenos married his daughter Theodora to Orhan and employed Ottoman warriors against the rival forces of the queen dowager , allowing them to loot Thrace . In the Byzantine civil war of 1352 -- 1357 , Kantakouzenos used Ottoman forces against John V himself , granting them the use of a European fortress at Çimpe around 1352 .

Q:Given the background: Retinitis is inflammation of the retina in the eye, which can permanently damage the retina and lead to blindness. The retina is the part of your eye that is also known as the \\"sensing tissue.\\" Retinitis may be caused by a number of different infectious agents. Retinitis, also called Retinitis pigmentosa, has a prevalence of one in every 2,500-7,000 people. This condition is one of the leading causes that leads to blindness in patients in the age range of 20–60 years old. and the situation: Local hospital has launched a program to check if a patient has Retinitis. Resident ophthalmologist David is in charge of this program. In the first day of the program he checked two patients, patient A and patient B.

Patient C was 40 years old, but patient D was 80 years old. He found both patient C and D had Retinitis. Answer the following question: For which patient Retinitis will not be one of the leading causes of blindness, patient C or patient D? A:","completion":"To answer the question, I need to identify for which patient Retinitis will not be one of the leading causes of blindness. Here are the steps I take to determine this: Step 1: Review the background information on Retinitis. Based on the background information provided, Retinitis is one of the leading causes of blindness in patients between the ages of 20 and 60. Step 2: Analyze the provided information on patient C and patient D. Patient C is 40 years old and has Retinitis. Patient D is 80 years old and has Retinitis. Step 3: Decide the relevance of the background information to patient C and patient D. Patient C is within the age range of 20-60 years, so Retinitis is considered one of the leading causes of blindness for them. Patient D is older than the age range mentioned (80 years old), so it is less likely that Retinitis is one of the leading causes of their blindness. Based on the analysis, Retinitis is not one of the leading causes of blindness for patient D because they fall outside the age range provided in the background information."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: You should never bribe a child to get them to do what you want. This teaches them a terrible behavior, which is that listening to you is negotiable. There will be many times when the temptation is strong but you should do whatever you can not to give in. Sometimes this means letting your child throw a tantrum in a grocery store and that's okay. The other customers will have a rough few minutes and go on with their lives but your child will learn good behavior for a lifetime. For example, when they throw a fit in the store about wanting a candy bar, don't say that they can have cake when they get home if they stop crying. All this does is teach them that if they cry at the store, they'll quickly earn themselves a treat. When your child does do something bad, do not give them attention for that behavior. This teaches them that in order to get your attention, they need to be naughty. Instead of acknowledging this behavior, even to yell at them, ignore them. When paired with hugs, kisses, and attention for good behavior, your child will quickly learn to behave. A bad example would be: grabbing their hands and yelling at them for doing something wrong or making them sit next to you for misbehaving at church. Instead, completely ignore them when they start throwing a tantrum. If you're at home put them in another room and then close the door. It doesn't need to be locked or slammed, it just needs to break contact. This will show the child that yelling is not the way to get your attention. Remember that to your toddler, the world is very big and pretty much 24/7 stress. Imagine how you feel when your boss makes a major change to how things work in your office. Now multiply that times thirty and imagine it happening every day for years. That's what it's like for your toddler. You have to be understanding and try not to overwhelm them with too many changes at once. Introduce schedule, lifestyle, and home changes gradually. You should also try to keep to a routine. When you have a routine, your child knows what to expect as is better able to handle small and gradual changes, like learning to use the toilet. For example, don't start potty training the same week they start at a new pre-school. In fact, waiting as much as a month before making another change can be necessary. Wait until they seem comfortable with one change before making another. If you have older children, you may be frustrated that your toddler doesn't do what the older child does or did. However, it's important to remember that your toddler hasn't learned those behaviors yet and won't be ready for them for awhile. Be ready to accommodate and work with their individual needs. For example, your toddler will probably need to have a different bedtime routine than an older child. They will probably wake up earlier and should not be expected to quietly entertain themselves on a weekend morning while you try to sleep in. Another common trigger for tantrums in toddlers are issues with stimulation. When they get bored, they don't have the mental ability that adults do to keep themselves entertained. Be understanding of this and try to find ways to keep them stimulated while you're out and away from the toys that usually keep them occupied. Keep a favored toy only for boredom emergencies, when you know you're both going to be stuck for awhile. This will keep your child entertained. You want to avoid making them overstimulated too. Too much stimulation, especially right before bed, can be a bit much for them and lead to breakdowns. Having a bunch of your friends over, making a major scheduling change, or even letting them watch TV can leave your little one feeling lost.","completion":"Bribing a child to comply with your wishes is not a recommended parenting practice, as it teaches the child that your authority is negotiable and promotes negative behavior. Avoid giving into the temptation to bribe, even when faced with tantrums in public places. Instead of acknowledging or rewarding bad behavior, focus on providing affection and attention for good behavior, which will help guide the child in the right direction. Ignoring tantrums and not reinforcing negative behavior will teach the child that acting out will not get them the attention they seek. When at home, it's helpful to separate them from the situation briefly by placing them in another room, emphasizing that their disruptive behavior will not yield any response from you. Toddlers experience constant changes and stressors in their lives, making it crucial for parents to be understanding and patient. Introducing changes gradually, maintaining a routine, and accommodating their individual needs will help them cope better. In addition, avoid comparing them with older siblings, as toddlers are still learning behaviors and may not be ready for certain expectations. When dealing with stimulation issues for toddlers, strike a balance between preventing boredom and avoiding over-stimulation. Carry a favorite toy for emergency situations when the child might feel bored, but also be mindful of reducing exposure to high-energy activities and chaotic environments that could lead to meltdowns. In summary, effective parenting means avoiding using bribes and promoting good behavior with affection and attention. Ignoring negative behavior, being patient with changes, accommodating the child's individual needs, and regulating stimulation will contribute to their overall development and help them learn to behave in a manner that's beneficial to both the child and the parent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To justify my response: 1. Extensive historical records support this claim. It's established knowledge within the domain of geography and history. 2. Vasco da Gama led the first expedition that sailed directly from Europe to India, departing from Portugal in 1497 and reaching Calicut (now Kozhikode) in India in 1498. 3. This was a significant discovery because it linked Europe and Asia by an ocean route, connecting the Atlantic and the Indian oceans and therefore, the West and the Orient. It was crucial for trade and cultural exchange. 4. This happened during the Age of Discovery, a period in history when Europeans significantly expanded their understanding of the world through maritime exploration.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: You shouldn't feel pressured to bulk up a survey with questions. The more questions you ask, the less likely it is that a customer will finish the survey. As a rule of thumb, ask no more than 10 questions, and preferably fewer. For example, you might only want to know someone's overall experience. In that situation, you can simply ask, “Please rate your overall experience on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the worst and 10 the best.” You can glean more information from a customer if you ask questions that can't be answered with a “yes” or “no.” For example, don't ask, “Were you happy with your experience?” Instead, you can ask, “What would you change about our business to improve it?” The second question can't be answered with a \\"yes\\" or \\"no.\\" If you use open-ended questions, you must decide where to put them. Some experts suggest putting them at the front of the survey so they are answered first. However, recent research suggests that open-ended questions can make a customer more positive than they normally would be when filling out the rest of the survey. Accordingly, you might want to put them at the end. You'll only waste people's time if you ask a bunch of irrelevant questions. Instead, you can segment your customer base. For example, you don't need to ask recent customers their opinions about your customer support, since they probably haven't used support yet. Segment your customer base any way you want. For example, if you offer many different services, you can segment them based on the service they use. Alternately, you can segment customers based on how long they have done business with you. One reason so few people offer feedback is that they don't really think you care. However, you should assure customers that you will respond promptly if they have a problem. Write, “We will respond ASAP to any concerns.” Remember to follow through.

The audience is provided with an insight into the world of the opening section's primary characters while concurrently observing the public re-emergence of a psychic, Simon Silver (Robert De Niro). The ending of the film's first half is signified by the sudden death of Matheson from a chronic vascular condition at the same time that one of Silver's comeback performances takes place; an incident that is particularly significant due to the death of a former nemesis of Silver, a skeptic who investigated the psychic's work, under similar circumstances. Matheson also had a previous encounter with Silver. She recounted a public meeting when Silver had, for an instant, got the best of her by bringing up the subject of her son's spirit (her son was in a vegetative coma and on life support). Matheson agrees only to appear on a televised panel in anticipation of Silver's return. Prior to her death, Matheson refuses to co-operate with Buckley's insistent call to undertake another investigation of Silver, warning Buckley against such an undertaking due to her previous experience with the psychic. However, following Matheson's death, the assistant becomes increasingly obsessed with investigating Silver for the purpose of exposing the popular psychic as a fraud.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Illegal immigrants working in UK face six months in prison, ministers announce It means that instead of being taken to detention centres, illegal migrants will be processed through the courts before being taken to jail. Ministers believe it will act as a deterrent and prevent thousands of migrants attempting to gain access to the UK from European ports including Calais. • If Britain bends to pressure, where would we put a quota of migrants? • Couple wed for 45 years claim immigration officials do not believe marriage is genuine As part of the new measures, off-licences, curry houses, Chinese restaurants and other takeaway firms will face closure if they are found to be employing illegal workers. The Government will also consider extending these powers to cover minicab firms, the Home Office said. It came as Eurotunnel services were on Monday hit by serious delays after migrants were found on French rail track near Calais. Migrants in France Photo: AFP Trains were held up by an hour after the migrants went on to the track in the area around Frethun station. Mr Brokenshire said: “Anyone who thinks the UK is a soft touch should be in no doubt – if you are here illegally, we will take action to stop you from working, renting a flat, opening a bank account or driving a car.” He added: “Through our new Immigration Bill, illegal workers will face the prospect of a prison term and rogue employers could have their businesses closed, have their licences removed, or face prosecution if they continue to flout the law.” The decision to impose prison sentences on illegal immigrants is a major shift in Government policy and shows the level of concern in Downing Street about the influx of foreigners coming to the UK. In the weeks after the general election, David Cameron vowed to make the UK a “less attractive place to come and work”. He announced plans to allow the police to seize wages from foreign workers and said that they would face deportation without appeal if they are in the UK illegally. However, he made no mention of potential prison sentences. It is thought that the migrant crisis in southern Europe and well as the increasing numbers of foreigners attempting to reach the UK from Calais have forced ministers to intensify the planned crackdown. Under the new rules, any employer suspected of flouting immigration laws could see their business closed for up to 48 hours while they prove right to work checks have been conducted on staff. Migrants wait near the perimeter fence at Calais Photo: Will Wintercross/The Telegraph • Calais migrants: Theresa May calls for 'urgent' security upgrade as 1,500 try to storm Channel Tunnel • French riot police in battle with Calais migrants, in pictures The worst offenders would then be placed under special measures and could face long-term closure. The Home Office said that any pub, off-licence or late-night takeaway that fails to comply with immigration laws or employs illegal workers could also be stripped of their licence to operate. Summary:","completion":"The government in the UK has announced that illegal immigrants working in the country could face six months in prison.

Narsingh is a proud and hot-tempered Rajput with a passion for his car, a vintage 1930 Chrysler and his Rajput heritage. Being a descendent of a royal Rajput family, his self-esteem is reflected through his inability to accept insult and defeat, as a result of which he even takes part in a small race with his car. He does not want to be the one who falls behind and develops a strong hatred for women and mankind in general. As a result of reckless driving, while overtaking the car which carried the district inspector, his licence is taken from him. He is utterly destroyed by it, since the cab was his life after his wife had left him for good. Deeply affected by the insult and a feeling of rootlessness, he decides to go back to the land of rajput where his true rajput lineage will be respected. While on an aimless journey, Narasingh is picked up by Sukharam who is a local Marwari businessman with a record of smuggling and human trafficking. Sukharam (Charuprakash Ghosh) offers him a handsome fee to transport some goods which actually is opium. The realisation of the immoral trade puts Narshing in a compromising position, but he decides to join hands with Sukharam anyway.

The Bangkok Post reported that Thai police arrested one man who is believed to be a drug addict in connection with the crime. Staff at the","completion":"Ayutthaya Elephant Palace were devastated by the loss of Klao, who had been an integral part of their family for many years. Klao had not only captured the hearts of millions through his role in Oliver Stone's movie but had also served as a gentle ambassador for the conservation of Asian elephants – a species facing significant threats from habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching for their ivory tusks. Upon discovering Klao's lifeless body, the caretakers notified local authorities, who immediately launched an investigation into the heinous crime. The rapid arrest of the suspect, a drug addict, sheds light on the desperate measures to which individuals looking to fund their habits may resort. In addition, this incident highlights the ongoing battle against illegal wildlife trade that threatens the survival of many endangered species. In response to this tragedy, authorities and conservation organizations called for an increase in anti-poaching efforts and better protection measures for elephants in the region. They demanded enhanced funding and resources for park rangers and wildlife protection units, as well as the strengthening of legal frameworks to tackle wildlife crimes more effectively. Furthermore, they urged for educational campaigns to raise awareness of the plight of Asian elephants, highlighting the negative impact of the ivory trade on both wildlife and local communities. To honor Klao's memory, the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace organized a memorial service, attended by the staff, local residents, and representatives from various conservation organizations. Visitors who had encountered Klao on their trips to the reserve shared their cherished memories of him, recalling his majestic presence and gentle nature. A tribute was also paid to Klao and other elephants tragically lost to poaching in the form of a touching video montage. In the wake of Klao's death, the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace and its partners in conservation worked tirelessly to combat the illegal wildlife trade, ensuring that no elephants in their care would suffer a similar fate. They also pledged to continue spreading awareness about the need for effective conservation measures and the importance of responsible ecotourism. Klao's legacy will live on through the collective efforts of the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace, the wider community, and the many people who were touched by his life. His story serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need to protect and preserve the dwindling populations of Asian elephants and other endangered species in the face of ongoing threats such as habitat destruction and the illegal wildlife trade. Through a combination of increased public awareness, effective policy and law enforcement, and conservation initiatives, Klao's memory will continue to inspire action toward a more sustainable future for these magnificent creatures and their fragile ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. Two teams of researchers studied different diseases. team Alpha studied people with cholesterol, while team Beta studied people with Parkinson's disease. Which team studied more people with cholesterol and other materials deposited on the interior of the arterial wall? A:","completion":"Team Alpha studied more people with cholesterol and other materials deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. This is because their research specifically focused on individuals with cholesterol-related issues, which are directly linked to the development of atherosclerosis, as described in the given information.

Lawyers for Brett Peter Cowan, who was convicted for the murder of 13-year-old schoolboy Daniel Morcombe in 2014, will file an application to have Chief Justice Tim Carmody disqualified from hearing his appeal, citing a potential bias in the case. Cowan received a life sentence for murdering, indecently dealing and dumping the Sunshine Coast teenager's body in 2003. Scroll down for video. Daniel Morcombe's killer Brett Peter Cowan mugshot, four months into his prison sentence in July this year. Cowan's barrister, Peter Davis, said Mr Carmody had met with Bravehearts founder Hetty Johnson shared an email, in which she referred to him as 'Tim' and included a smiley face. Mr Davis said Bravehearts' interests were contrary to Cowan's, which created the conflict. 'It's not suggested for a moment that Bravehearts is a dubious organisation, however it's a lobby group and Mr Cowan is someone who has been directly targeted by that very lobby group,' Mr Davis said. Mr Carmody denied he had any sort of relationship with Ms Johnson, and said the meeting was standard practice. 'None of these meetings impede my neutrality or impartial discharge of my judicial function,' he said. 'Ms Johnston and I do not have a relevant, close and continuing relationship that would impact on the impartiality of my decisions or processes.'

Daniel Morcombe was only 13 when he was abducted and murdered in December 2003, waiting at a bus stop to go Christmas shopping. Cowan's sentence includes a non-parole period of 20 years. When he was convicted, Cowan was found guilty of murder, indecent treatment of a child and interfering with a corpse, after abusing and killing Daniel in an abandoned house after abducting the teen from a Sunshine Coast bus stop.

Lawyers are also expected to criticise what they say was biased media coverage of the trial. Daniel, 13, was abducted in 2003 on Queensland's Sunshine Coast while waiting for a bus to go Christmas shopping.
