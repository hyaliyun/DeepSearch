Fulcrum position: The placement of the fulcrum can affect the force needed to move a load on the lever. If the fulcrum is closer to the load, less force is needed to move it. If the fulcrum is moved further away from the load, more force is needed. 3. Leverage direction: Levers can change the direction of a force. For example, a lever can be used to lift objects vertically, even though the force is applied horizontally. Levers are used in many applications in daily life, from playground equipment like seesaws and swings, to construction machinery such as cranes and backhoes.

The 18th century was characterized by a shift towards the Rococo style, which was characterized by its lightness, delicacy, and grace. One of the key features of 18th-century European fashion was the use of luxurious fabrics such as silk, satin, and velvet. These materials were often embroidered, beaded, or embellished with lace, giving clothing a rich and intricate texture. This was particularly true of women's clothing, which often featured elaborate, flowing gowns with fitted bodices and full, wide skirts. Another hallmark of 18th-century fashion was the use of corsets, which were worn by women to achieve a more slender, hourglass figure. These corsets were often made of stiff materials such as whalebone or steel and were laced tightly around the waist to create the desired effect. Men's clothing also underwent significant changes during this time, with the adoption of more fitted and tailored suits, often made from wool or silk. Throughout the 18th century, fashion was heavily influenced by the cultural and artistic movements of the time. One of the most significant of these was the Rococo movement, which emphasized frivolity, sensuality, and delicate, asymmetrical designs. This aesthetic was reflected in the clothing of the time, which often featured ornate embroidery, lace, and ribbons. Towards the end of the century, a new cultural movement emerged that stressed simplicity, modesty, and rationalism. This was reflected in the clothing styles of the time, which became more austere and functional. Women's clothing became more streamlined, with high-waisted gowns that fell to the floor, while men's clothing became even more tailored and fitted.

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a wayward behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.","completion":"\\"Understanding the Waywardness of Fine-Tuning Continuous Prompts for Textual Interpretations\\""},{"prompt":"Can renewable energy sources fully replace nonrenewable ones?","completion":"Yes, renewable energy sources can fully replace non-renewable ones."},{"prompt":"Which Australian artist is known for their work in Indigenous art?","completion":"There are many Australian artists known for their work in Indigenous art, some notable ones include Emily Kngwarreye, Rover Thomas, and Judy Watson Napangardi."},{"prompt":"w can you write a tribute song?","completion":"To write a tribute song, you can start by making a list of qualities or memorable moments you want to celebrate about the person.

It has had a significant impact on the job market, leading to both opportunities and challenges. While automation has created new jobs and increased productivity, it has also caused significant job losses in certain industries. As a result, labour ministries play a crucial role in addressing unemployment caused by automation. One of the biggest impacts of automation is the displacement of workers. Automation has replaced manual labour with machines, causing a shift in the demand for certain types of labour. As a result, many workers have been left without jobs, struggling to find alternatives in a rapidly changing job market. This can have a significant impact on the economy, as workers who have lost their jobs may be unable to find new work, leading to increased poverty and inequality. Labour ministries have a critical role in addressing unemployment caused by automation. They can create programs that offer retraining and reskilling to displaced workers. This can help workers gain the skills they need to find new employment in growing industries. Additionally, labour ministries can partner with private sector organizations to encourage collaboration on workforce development and market-based solutions. Governments can also play a role in supporting the development of new industries that create jobs. For example, as automation decreases the demand for certain types of labour, it may also create new job opportunities in fields such as robotics and artificial intelligence. By investing in these industries and encouraging growth, governments can help stimulate job creation in areas that are less likely to be affected by automation. The impact of automation on the job market is not limited to low-skilled labour. Automation can also lead to job losses in highly skilled fields such as finance, medicine, and law. As a result, labour ministries may also need to focus on creating programs that support workers in high-demand fields to adapt to changes in the job market. In conclusion, automation has had a significant impact on the job market, creating new opportunities while also leading to job losses in certain industries. Labour ministries play a crucial role in addressing unemployment caused by automation by creating programs that offer retraining and reskilling to displaced workers, supporting the development of new industries, and ensuring that workers in high-demand fields are equipped to adapt to changes in the job market. By working together with the private sector and other stakeholders, labour ministries can support workers and ensure a just transition to a more automated economy."},{"prompt":"w can someone get started with DIY projects?","completion":"To get started with DIY projects, one can follow these steps: 1.

These effects were both positive and negative, and they continue to impact the continent to this day. One of the positive effects of decolonization on African society was the restoration of national pride and independence. For centuries, African nations had been colonized and exploited by European powers. The process of decolonization allowed African nations to regain their sovereignty and pursue their own political and economic interests. This newfound independence sparked a sense of national identity and pride that had been suppressed for generations. However, decolonization also had negative effects on African society. Many African nations were left economically and politically unstable after gaining independence. In some cases, former colonizers left behind corrupt governments and leaders who perpetuated the exploitation and oppression of their own people. This led to widespread poverty, inequality, and conflict across the continent. Moreover, decolonization often resulted in the lumping together of different ethnic and linguistic groups into single nation-states, resulting in tensions and conflicts between different groups. Many African nations struggled to establish an identity and unify their diverse populations, leading to further instability. Additionally, the legacy of colonialism continued to impact African society long after decolonization. Many African economies remained heavily reliant on exportation of raw materials, leading to stagnation and limited diversification. Furthermore, the political, social, and cultural systems left in place by colonizers often perpetuated inequalities and prejudices that continue to impact African societies today. In conclusion, the effects of decolonization on African society were complex and multi-faceted. While it allowed for a restoration of national pride and independence, it also led to economic and political instability, ethnic tensions, and continued effects of colonialism. Understanding these effects is crucial to addressing the challenges faced by African societies today."},{"prompt":"Provide a brief history of Zionism and the key figures associated with it.","completion":"Zionism is a political movement that emerged in the late 19th century, with the aim of establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine.

This process is called coalification. The first stage of coal formation is the accumulation of plant material, which is typically deposited in swamps or marshes. Over time, this material is buried by sediment and undergoes physical and chemical changes that cause it to transform into peat. Over millions of years, the weight of the sediment and other material on top of the peat compresses it, transforming it into lignite, a low-grade coal. Further heat and pressure cause the lignite to transform into sub-bituminous, bituminous, and finally anthracite coal, which is the highest grade. Once coal has been formed and is buried underground, it can be extracted through a process called mining. There are two main types of mining: surface mining and underground mining. Surface mining involves the removal of surface layers using heavy equipment, such as bulldozers and excavators, to expose the coal seams. The coal is then extracted using explosives or large machines to dig out the coal. Underground mining, on the other hand, involves the creation of tunnels to access the coal seams, and the use of equipment and techniques to extract the coal from underground. Both types of mining have significant impacts on the environment and can cause pollution and other environmental problems."},{"prompt":"What are some common receptor types involved in cell signaling, and how do they work?","completion":"Some common receptor types involved in cell signaling are: 1. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs): They work by binding to ligands (signaling molecules) which activate the GPCR. This, in turn, activates a G-protein, which then triggers a cellular response. 2. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs): They work by binding to their ligands, which causes the RTK to dimerize (meaning two RTKs bind to each other). This dimerization activates the intracellular kinase domains, which then phosphorylate (add a phosphate group) to downstream signaling molecules. 3. Ligand-gated ion channels: They work by binding to their ligands, which causes the ion channel to open and allow ions to pass through the channel. This causes a change in the membrane potential of the cell, leading to a cellular response. 4. Nuclear receptors: They work by binding to their ligands, which allows the receptor-ligand complex to enter the nucleus and bind to DNA. This, in turn, affects gene expression and leads to cellular responses. These receptors work by detecting and responding to specific extracellular signals, leading to intracellular signaling cascades that ultimately result in a cellular response."},{"prompt":"Analyze the recurring themes and symbolism in the webcomic A Softer World.","completion":"The recurring themes in \\"A Softer World\\" include love, loss, loneliness, existentialism, and dark humor.

The problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits each of a given set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting city. One way to solve this problem is to use heuristic algorithms such as the nearest neighbor algorithm, which starts at a random city and repeatedly visits the closest city until all cities have been visited. Another algorithm is the genetic algorithm, which mimics the natural selection process to search for an optimal solution. Exact solutions can also be obtained using mathematical programming techniques such as integer linear programming, where the problem is formulated as a set of linear equations with binary decision variables indicating whether a particular edge is included in the route or not. Overall, the appropriate solution method depends on the size of the problem, the required degree of precision and the time frame available for computation."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},B={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],R={key:0},D={key:1};function H(n,e,l,p,o,s){const u=g("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",E,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(i(!0),a(b,null,w(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(i(),k(u,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",B,' No results found for "'+h(o.searchQuery)+'".
