Before anything else, it's essential to remove any organs that may be inside the turkey's cavity. Once that's done, you can decide whether to brine the turkey or not. Brining can add moisture and flavor to the bird, but it's not necessary. If you choose to brine, be sure to plan ahead as it can take several hours or even overnight. Thawing the turkey is the next crucial step. The safest method is to thaw it in the fridge, which can take a few days depending on the turkey's size. However, if time is of the essence, you can use the cold water method, but be sure to change the water every thirty minutes to prevent bacteria growth. After the turkey has been thawed, you can add flavor by covering it with a rub, glaze, or basic seasoning. A rub is a combination of herbs and spices that can be massaged into the turkey's skin for added flavor. A glaze, typically made with ingredients like honey or maple syrup, can be brushed onto the turkey during the last thirty minutes of cooking. Finally, basic seasoning like salt and pepper can be used to enhance the turkey's natural flavor.

He has publicly criticized the media for their unacceptable attitude towards black actors and their limited opportunities for mainstream success within the UK.

He cited the example of Hackney-born actor, Idris Elba, who landed his breakout role as Detective John Luther in the BBC drama 'Luther' after making a name for himself in the acclaimed HBO series 'The Wire'. Umunna's comments are significant, as they highlight important issues such as systemic racism and the limited, stereotypical roles that are often available for black actors within the UK.

The killing of Marius was particularly controversial as it was carried out in front of a crowd and the giraffe was subsequently fed to the lions. The backlash was so enormous that the zoo's scientific director Bengt Holst received death threats. The Copenhagen Zoo has a reputation for breeding healthy animals with good genetic variance, but the recent events have led many to question the ethics behind such practices.

Observations at the Greenwich Observatory itself ceased in 1954, though the location is still used as the basis for the coordinate system.

Treat ingrown hairs. See a dermatologist in the event of an infection.","completion":"Red spots on the skin can be a common and somewhat concerning issue for many people. However, the presence of these spots does not necessarily indicate anything serious or dangerous. In fact, most red spots on the skin are just a benign cosmetic issue that can be treated with some simple measures. One common cause of red spots on the skin is ingrown hairs. This occurs when a hair follicle grows back into the skin, leading to inflammation and redness. The good news is that this is a relatively easy issue to treat. The first step is to gently exfoliate the area using a mild scrub or brush. This will help to remove any dead skin cells, which can sometimes trap hair follicles and cause them to grow in the wrong direction. In addition to exfoliation, applying warm compresses to the affected area can also help to soothe irritation and reduce inflammation. In some cases, ingrown hairs can become infected, which can cause more serious symptoms such as pus, tenderness, and fever. If this happens, it is important to see a dermatologist as soon as possible. They can prescribe antibiotics or other medications to help clear up the infection and prevent it from spreading. In summary, if you have red spots on your skin, there is no need to panic. In most cases, they are caused by ingrown hairs, which can be treated with some easy and effective measures. However, if you notice any signs of infection, such as pus or fever, it is important to seek medical attention from a dermatologist. By taking these steps, you can keep your skin healthy, smooth, and free from harm."},{"prompt":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","completion":"Context: Many people have reported feeling anxious or stressed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to the legend, when a new king was crowned in Bohemia, he had to undergo a test to prove his worthiness to rule. The test involved placing the Bohemian crown on the head of a prisoner or slave, who was then given the opportunity to take revenge on the new king. The story goes that the tradition began in the 13th century when Ottokar II of Bohemia ascended to the throne. To prove his worthiness to rule, he had to place the crown on the head of a condemned criminal. The criminal, it is said, was given the opportunity to take revenge on the king but instead praised him for his fairness and mercy. From that day on, it became a tradition for every new king of Bohemia to undergo this test. The legend has been used to demonstrate the importance of justice and mercy in the exercise of power. It is a reminder that those who hold power must be held accountable and that their actions must be just and fair. It also highlights the fact that the exercise of power must be tempered by a sense of compassion and empathy for those who are less fortunate. While there is no historical evidence to support the legend, it has become an integral part of Bohemian folklore and is still retold today. It is a testament to the enduring power of storytelling and the human need for legends and myths to help us make sense of the world around us."},{"prompt":"This house believes the Upper House should be accountable to the people What is a possible side to this debate?","completion":"A possible opposing side to this debate would be that the Upper House should remain a separate and independent body, not directly accountable to the people, in order to provide checks and balances on the decisions made by the Lower House."},{"prompt":"Generate short a sentence that is linguistically unacceptable","completion":"Butterfly shoes tastes like purple dream."},{"prompt":"Good morning virtual world Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.

Insists White Dee has a 'lot to offer' and needs to get back to work. Comes after she returned home from four day holiday to Spain. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Former MP Simon Danczuk has raised concerns over young people's attitude towards benefits, stating that many believe they can become famous by claiming them. Danczuk's comments come after reality TV star \\"White Dee\\" was criticized for going on a four-day holiday to Spain. Danczuk, however, defended her, stating that she has \\"a lot to offer\\" and needs to get back to work. The comments highlight growing concerns about the UK's welfare system and the impact it may be having on younger generations. A recent report by the think tank Resolution Foundation suggested that over a third of young people in the UK are now living in poverty, with many struggling to find secure work. Danczuk's remarks about White Dee, whose real name is Deirdre Kelly, have also reignited the debate about whether reality TV stars should be held up as role models. Kelly rose to fame on the reality TV show Benefits Street, which followed the lives of people living on benefits in Birmingham. Since then, she has appeared on a number of other shows, including Celebrity Big Brother and This Morning. Critics argue that shows like Benefits Street and their stars are problematic because they perpetuate negative stereotypes about people on benefits. However, defenders of Kelly and other reality TV stars argue that they are simply trying to make a living and that they should not be criticized for taking advantage of opportunities that come their way. Regardless of where you stand on this issue, it is clear that Danczuk's comments about young people's attitudes towards benefits are worrying. While there will always be people who try to game the system, it is important to remember that many people rely on benefits to get by. Rather than demonizing those who claim benefits, perhaps we should focus on creating a fairer society where everyone has the opportunity to succeed."},{"prompt":"Write a positive yelp review.","completion":"\\"Great experience!

For example, in the 19th century a number of European policing agencies undertook crossborder surveillance because of concerns about anarchist agitators and other political radicals. A notable example of this was the occasional surveillance by Prussian police of Karl Marx during the years he remained resident in London. The interests of public police agencies in crossborder cooperation in the control of political radicalism and ordinary law crime were primarily initiated in Europe, which eventually led to the establishment of Interpol before the Second World War. There are also many interesting examples of crossborder policing under private auspices and by municipal police forces that date back to the 19th century (Nadelmann, 1993). It has been established that modern policing has transgressed national boundaries from time to time almost from its inception.

Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect which is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and The Hymn to Ninkasi, a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.

Bituminous sands are mined using enormous (100 ton capacity) power shovels and loaded into even larger (400 ton capacity) dump trucks for movement to an upgrading facility.

Tax deductions decrease your taxable income, which in turn lowers your tax liability. Tax credits, on the other hand, directly reduce your tax liability. By taking advantage of these deductions and credits, you can potentially save a significant amount of money on your taxes. One commonly overlooked deduction is the standard deduction. This is a set dollar amount that the government allows you to deduct from your taxable income based on your filing status (single, married filing jointly, etc.). Depending on your income level and other factors, it may be more beneficial to take the standard deduction rather than itemizing your deductions. However, if you do decide to itemize, there are several expenses that you can deduct. These include mortgage interest, property taxes, charitable donations, and certain medical expenses. Keep in mind that there may be limits to these deductions depending on your income level and other factors. In addition to deductions, there are also several tax credits available. One of the most significant is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which is designed to help low to moderate income earners. Depending on your income and family situation, you may be eligible for a credit of up to several thousand dollars. Other potential tax credits include the Child Tax Credit, the American Opportunity Tax Credit (for education expenses), and the Saver's Credit (for retirement contributions). Again, eligibility for these credits will depend on a variety of factors, so it's important to consult with a tax professional or use tax preparation software to determine what you qualify for. In conclusion, taking advantage of tax deductions and credits can help you save money on your taxes and keep more of your hard-earned income. By understanding what deductions and credits are available to you and consulting with a professional if necessary, you can make the most of this opportunity and potentially reduce your tax liability significantly."},{"prompt":"Sentence: Appleton International Airport, with a runway length of 1,982, can be found in Greenville, Wisconsin.

They met with considerable success as many of the native Welsh rulers, resentful of Llywelyn's overlordship, surrendered and joined the English. In July 1277, Edward launched a punitive expedition into North Wales with his own army of 15,500 — of whom 9,000 were Welshmen from the south — raised through a traditional feudal summons. From Chester the army marched into Gwynedd, camping first at Flint and then Rhuddlan and Deganwy, most likely causing significant damage to the areas it advanced through. A fleet from the Cinque ports provided naval support. Llywelyn soon realised his position was hopeless and quickly surrendered. The campaign never came to a major battle.

It may be that he was running short of men and supplies by November 1277 and, in any case, complete conquest of Llywelyn's territories had not been his objective.","completion":"What was Edward's strategy for conquering Wales in 1277 and why did he decide to negotiate a settlement rather than attempt total conquest?"},{"prompt":"defense secretary william j. perry said sunday that the bosnian serbs had demonstrated their superiority on the battlefield and that the muslimled bosnian government would be unable to reverse their gains even if nato warplanes came to its aid .

They are then reflected back. You can predict the angle of the reflected light. Imagine a ball bouncing off a surface. Light can do the same thing. That is, assuming the surface is shiny. So how do you know where light will go after it strikes a shiny surface? It depends on how the light initially strikes the shiny object. Light does not always go straight toward a surface. Therefore, not all light bounces straight back. Sometimes, light can hit a surface at an angle. The angle at which it strikes the surface tells us how it will bounce off. While light is different to a ball, they react in a similar manner. Many sports rely on knowledge of reflection. Pool players know a lot about reflection. They take great care when they strike the pool ball. They need it to go to a certain place. They know the angle it will hit the side of the pool table.

Despite the UK Ministry of Defence's strict security ban on the recording of journals, Barclay chronicled his experiences as an RAF airman during World War II. And now, decades after his death, his diary has been published, shedding light on the incredible life of the young pilot. Born in 1921, Barclay joined the RAF at the age of 20, marked by a burning desire to serve his country amidst the chaos of war. He soon found himself stationed in France, where he would fly missions against German targets. However, he was shot down three times - each time surviving, only to return to the front lines. Such resilience is a testament to his unwavering determination to fight for what he believed in. One of Barclay's greatest feats was his escape from occupied France. He employed a daring tactic by turning his uniform inside out, which allowed him to blend in with the local population and avoid being captured by German forces. Such cunning and quick thinking displays why he was such a valuable asset to the RAF. Sadly, Barclay was ultimately killed in action in 1942, as he commanded a Hurricane squadron at El Alamein. Yet his diary, consisting of 80 pages of entries, stories, and sketches, offers a window into his life and experiences, revealing the young man behind the battlefield hero. Ironically, his family was unaware of the diary's existence for many years, only discovering it recently. George Barclay was a man whose bravery and dedication to duty epitomized the spirit of the RAF.

The next day, in March 2010, Mrs Hosfield died from a morphine overdose. Coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure after twoday inquest.","completion":"Betty Horsfield, an 80-year-old woman, was suffering from unbearable pain due to her breast cancer. In an attempt to ease her pain, her daughter Dawn Ellis called their family doctor, Dr Mushkoor Sheikh, and requested a home visit. However, to their dismay, Dr Sheikh allegedly refused to come out and simply prescribed morphine over the phone. The unfortunate incident occurred in March 2010 and the next day, Mrs Horsfield passed away from a morphine overdose. The coroner was then called in to investigate the incident, and after a two-day inquest, they recorded a verdict of misadventure. The tragedy experienced by Mrs Horsfield and her family highlights the importance of having proper medical attention, especially in cases of chronic illnesses such as cancer. It is understandable that some doctors may feel hesitant in making house calls, but sometimes it may be the only option for patients who are unable to come to their offices due to their health condition. In line with this, doctors must show empathy and a willingness to help their patients alleviate their pain and suffering. Furthermore, prescribing medication over the phone without a proper physical examination can be dangerous, and it is important for doctors to remember that. Patients may accidentally overdose or have adverse reactions to their medication due to incorrect dosage, which can lead to dire consequences as seen in Mrs Horsfield's case. In conclusion, the tragic loss of Mrs Horsfield should serve as a reminder of the critical role that doctors play in the lives of their patients. It is essential for doctors to prioritize their patient's well-being and health, even in situations where it may be an inconvenience to themselves. Regular check-ups, personalized treatment plans, and close monitoring of their patients' health conditions can go a long way in preventing such tragic incidents from happening in the future."},{"prompt":"During the Gulf War , the NPC called the Gulf Crisis Working Group , a coalition of several groups that had organized .

Poetry has traditionally been distinguished from prose by its being set in verse;[a] prose is cast in sentences, poetry in lines; the syntax of prose is dictated by meaning, whereas that of poetry is held across metre or the visual aspects of the poem. Prior to the nineteenth century, poetry was commonly understood to be something set in metrical lines; accordingly, in 1658 a definition of poetry is any kind of subject consisting of Rythm or Verses.

He says he arrived from Spain in November to 'resolve a family dispute' But failed and now waiting for relatives to send money for his return flight. He eats from bins and reclaims coins from abandoned trolleys for money. His story has echoes of the 2004 comedy The Terminal, starring Tom Hanks.","completion":"Rodrigo Ben-Azul is one of the many unfortunate souls who have fallen through the cracks of society. He now lives at Santiago Airport, Chile, simply because he ran out of money. According to Rodrigo, he arrived in Chile from Spain in November in an attempt to 'resolve a family dispute.' Unfortunately, it didn't work out, and he now finds himself stranded at the airport, waiting for his relatives to send him the money he needs to buy a return ticket. Rodrigo's desperate situation has forced him to resort to eating from bins and scavenging abandoned trolleys for coins. His story may remind some of the 2004 comedy The Terminal, which starred Tom Hanks. In that movie, Hanks played a man who was denied entry to the United States and had to live in a New York airport. However, while the movie was fictional, Rodrigo's story is very real. It's hard to imagine how difficult it must be for Rodrigo to live in such a state of limbo. As he waits for his relatives to send the money he needs to buy a return ticket, he has no choice but to live off whatever scraps he can find. It's a harsh reality, and one that highlights the very real consequences of the global pandemic. Unfortunately, Rodrigo's situation is not unique. As the pandemic continues to ravage the world, many people have found themselves in similarly dire circumstances. They have lost their jobs, their homes, and their dignity. Their stories are a reminder that we must do better as a society. We must come up with solutions to help those who are struggling to make ends meet and provide them with the assistance they need to get back on their feet. In the meantime, we can only hope that Rodrigo's relatives will send him the money he needs to buy a return ticket. We can only hope that he'll be able to leave the airport and start a new chapter in his life. Until then, his story serves as a powerful reminder of the resilience of the human spirit in times of crisis."},{"prompt":"Write a sentence that about [Alimentum food Fast food; Alimentum priceRange less than £20; Alimentum area riverside; Alimentum familyFriendly yes].","completion":"Alimentum is a family-friendly fast food restaurant located in the riverside area, with prices under £20."},{"prompt":"Soma, Turkey (CNN Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"I'm sorry, but I need the specific article you are referring to as there are many articles about Soma, Turkey on CNN."},{"prompt":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Impulsora del Deportivo Necaxa S.A. de C.V.

The Fire Brigades Union has argued that raising the pension age from 55 to 60 would put firefighters at risk, as they would be required to work in physically demanding roles well into their 60s. The government, however, has stated that the current pension system is unsustainable and that reforms are necessary to address the funding deficit. The London Fire Brigade, who had contingency plans in place during the strike, stated that the response to the incident was not affected. However, the Fire Brigades Union has argued that the contingency plans failed, and that this incident highlights the danger of relying on these plans during industrial action. This tragic incident serves as a reminder of the bravery of firefighters and the dangers that they face on a daily basis. It also highlights the ongoing dispute between firefighters and the government over pension reform. Both sides must work together to find a resolution that ensures the safety of firefighters while also addressing the funding deficit in the pension system."},{"prompt":"Math Problem Solve 199 234 = 5*r for r.","completion":"r = 7"},{"prompt":"ere is a goal: ice cream scoop Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?

If you're trying to identify a particular breed of dog, for example, there are several characteristics you should keep an eye out for. First, check for a spotted coat. While not all breeds have a spotted coat, many do - such as the Dalmatian, the Catahoula Leopard Dog, and the American Leopard Hound. These breeds are known for their unique coats, which often feature spots of varying sizes and colors. Another important trait to look for is the right color pattern. Some breeds have distinct color patterns that can help you identify them at a glance. For example, the Australian Cattle Dog is known for its blue or red speckled coat, while the Siberian Husky often has a white coat with dark markings. By familiarizing yourself with the specific color patterns of different breeds, you can quickly spot the breed you're looking for. Finally, notice the build of the animal in question. Many dog breeds have a certain body type that is associated with them. You may notice a large, athletic build in breeds like the German Shepherd, Boxer and Doberman Pinscher. These dogs are often muscular and agile, with a powerful presence. By taking into account the size and build of the animal you're trying to identify, you can narrow down the possibilities and make a more accurate guess.
