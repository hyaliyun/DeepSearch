Over time, the caste system became more rigid and hierarchical, with the addition of many more sub-castes (jatis) based on factors such as geography and ancestry. People were born into their caste and could not change it, and there were strict rules about interaction between different castes. During the British colonial period, the caste system was codified and made more rigid. This led to a resurgence of social reform movements in India that sought to challenge the caste system and promote equality.

Consider a right-angled triangle with sides a, b, and c where c is the hypotenuse. Draw a perpendicular line from the right angle to the hypotenuse as shown: \`\`\` /| / | / | / | a / | b / | / | /_______| c \`\`\` This divides the triangle into two smaller triangles, which are similar to the original triangle and to each other. One of these triangles has sides a, x and h, where h is the height of the perpendicular from the right angle to the hypotenuse, and x is the length of the hypotenuse of this smaller triangle: \`\`\` /| / | / | / | a / h | x / | / | /_______| c \`\`\` The other triangle has sides b, (c - x) and h: \`\`\` /| / | / | / | b / h | c-x / | / | /_______| c \`\`\` Since the two smaller triangles are similar to each other and to the original triangle, we can write: a / x = x / (c - x) (using the triangle with sides a, x, h) b / (c - x) = (c - x) / x (using the triangle with sides b, c - x, h) Cross-multiplying and simplifying these equations, we get: x^2 = ac - ax x^2 = bc - bx Adding these two equations, we get: 2x^2 = ac - ax + bc - bx 2x^2 = (a + b)c - (a + b)x Dividing both sides by 2(a + b), we get: x^2 = (a + b)c / 2(a + b) - x x^2 = c / 2 - x x = (c / 2)^(1/2) Substituting this value of x into the equation x^2 = ac - ax, we get: (c / 2) = (a^2 + b^2) / c c^2 = 4a^2 + 4b^2 c^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab Since a, b and c are lengths of sides of a right-angled triangle, we know that a, b and c are positive numbers. Therefore, we can take the square root of both sides to obtain: c = (a^2 + b^2)^(1/2) Thus, we have proved the Pythagorean theorem."},{"prompt":"Provide a recipe for a Kosher Passover meal.","completion":"Ingredients: - 1 small beef brisket - 2 onions, sliced - 3 cloves of garlic, chopped - 5 carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces - 5 celery stalks, cut into 1-inch pieces - 2 cups of beef broth - 1 cup of red wine - 1 tablespoon of tomato paste - 1 tablespoon of paprika - Salt and pepper to taste Instructions: 1.

Statelessness can result from various factors such as discriminatory nationality laws, arbitrary revocation of nationality, or conflicts that cause displacement. It leads to the denial of human rights and social services, and can make people vulnerable to exploitation and human trafficking. Statelessness also poses ethical questions on the responsibilities of states in protecting the rights of those who are stateless. States have the obligation to ensure that everyone has a nationality and to prevent statelessness. However, some states fail to recognize stateless individuals or provide them with adequate protection, leaving them without legal identity and subject to discrimination. Moreover, nationality laws can be discriminatory, leading to further ethical dilemmas regarding equal access to citizenship. For example, some countries deny citizenship to children born to non-citizen parents, or restrict citizenship based on gender or religion. This leads to the marginalization of certain groups and can perpetuate cycles of poverty and vulnerability. In conclusion, addressing statelessness and discriminatory nationality laws requires a commitment to uphold the human rights of all individuals regardless of their legal status or origin. It requires a reevaluation of current laws and policies to ensure they do not exclude or marginalize individuals or groups."},{"prompt":"w do advocacy groups use social media to promote their message?","completion":"Advocacy groups use social media to promote their message by creating compelling content that resonates with their target audience, using hashtags to increase visibility and awareness, collaborating with influencers and other organizations, holding online events and campaigns, and engaging with their followers to foster a sense of community and encourage active involvement."},{"prompt":"Name an Atari game that was released in the year 1980.","completion":"\\"Missile Command\\" was released in 1980 for Atari."},{"prompt":"w did Indian royalty shape the political landscape of India over time?","completion":"Indian royalty played a significant role in shaping the political landscape of India over time through their control over resources, military power, and political authority.

They were sent as punishment for their crimes and were made to work as labourers in the colony. 2) The post-war era (1945-1970s): This was a period of mass migration to Australia due to the country's need for workers to help rebuild after World War II. Many displaced persons, refugees, and skilled workers from Europe migrated during this time. 3) The contemporary era (1980s-present): This period saw an increasing number of asylum seekers and refugees from countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria fleeing persecution and conflict in their home countries. While all three waves of forced migration involved people being uprooted from their homes and forced to relocate to a new country, there are some key differences. The convict era was characterized by a lack of choice on the part of the migrants, who were forcibly removed from their homes and sent to Australia as punishment. In contrast, migrants during the post-war and contemporary eras were much more likely to choose to come to Australia, either for economic or humanitarian reasons. Additionally, while the convicts who were transported to Australia were typically from Britain and Ireland, migrants during the post-war and contemporary eras have come from a much wider range of countries and regions around the globe.

It emphasizes the importance of case law and relies on judges to interpret laws and establish legal precedents. Civil law systems, on the other hand, rely more heavily on written laws and codes, rather than judicial decisions. Here are three examples of how common law and civil law systems differ in different countries: 1. United States: The United States is a common law country, and its legal system is based on the English common law tradition. One of the key principles of common law in the US is the doctrine of stare decisis, which means that courts are bound by previous decisions made in similar cases. This principle helps to establish consistency in legal rulings over time. 2. France: France is a civil law country, and its legal system is largely based on the Napoleonic Code. In civil law systems like France, judges are tasked with interpreting and applying the law as it is written, rather than relying on precedent. This means that legal decisions in civil law countries are often more predictable and consistent than those in common law systems. 3. China: China has a mixed legal system that combines elements of both common law and civil law. China's legal system has been heavily influenced by both European legal traditions, as well as traditional Chinese legal practices. In practice, Chinese judges often rely on past court decisions as a basis for their rulings, but they are not strictly bound by precedent in the same way as judges in common law systems like the US."},{"prompt":"What role did Estonia play in the Soviet Union era?","completion":"Estonia was a republic of the Soviet Union, playing a significant role in the Soviet Union era from 1944 until the country regained independence in 1991."},{"prompt":"What are the common Islamrelated controversies and how have they affected the Muslim community?","completion":"Some common Islam-related controversies include issues concerning the wearing of the hijab, terrorism, Sharia law, and the role of women in Islamic societies.
