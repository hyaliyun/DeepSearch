Currently UK pilots are limited to 18. hours without sleep. But more than four out of ten pilots. already report nodding off inflight.","completion":"The safety of air travel has been a top priority for decades. One of the primary concerns is the well-being of pilots. In order to ensure that pilots are alert and focused while operating an aircraft, there have been restrictions put in place to regulate the amount of time that they can be awake before flying. In the UK, pilots are currently limited to 18 hours without sleep before they are required to rest for a specified period before flying again. However, under new rules, pilots could be landing commercial jets after 22 hours awake. This extension has caused significant controversy within the aviation industry, with many concerned about the safety implications of tired pilots. The statistics are alarming - more than four out of ten pilots already report nodding off in-flight. This figure is concerning, and it is essential that more measures are taken to ensure that pilots are well-rested and alert while operating an aircraft. The risks associated with flying while tired are significant. Fatigue can impair a pilot's judgment, reaction time, and ability to perform complex tasks. These factors could potentially have catastrophic consequences, particularly if a pilot falls asleep at the controls. While many in the aviation industry are pushing for longer working hours for pilots, others are calling for more caution. The regulations surrounding the amount of time that pilots can be awake before flying should not be taken lightly, and any changes made should be made only after thorough consideration of the risks and benefits. In the end, it is the safety of all passengers that must be the priority. It is crucial that pilots are well-rested and focused when performing their duties. Any changes to existing regulations must not compromise this key principle."},{"prompt":"Roman Catholic Jesuits and Capuchins arrived from Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Limit alcohol consumption. Eat junk food sparingly.","completion":"The key to a healthy lifestyle is to maintain a balanced diet and avoid excessive consumption of substances that can harm our body. Caffeine, a common component found in coffee, tea, and energy drinks, can be helpful in boosting energy levels, but excessive caffeine intake can lead to increased anxiety, sleep disturbances, high blood pressure, and heart palpitations. Therefore, it is essential to limit caffeine intake to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Alcohol consumption should also be moderated, as excessive drinking can cause liver disease, stroke, and cancer. Studies show that even moderate drinking can increase the risk of breast cancer in women. Therefore, it is recommended to limit alcohol consumption or avoid it altogether. Junk food, while tasty and convenient, should be eaten sparingly, as it is usually high in calories, fat, and sugar. Regular consumption of fast food and processed snacks can lead to weight gain, high cholesterol levels, and other health problems. Incorporating nutritious foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins into one's diet can provide essential nutrients and help maintain a healthy weight. It's all about finding a balance between eating healthy foods and indulging in occasional treats. In conclusion, a key aspect of maintaining a healthy lifestyle is to be mindful of what we consume. Limiting caffeine and alcohol consumption and eating junk food sparingly can go a long way in improving our overall health and reducing the risk of various diseases. With a balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle, we can achieve optimal health and lead a fulfilling life."},{"prompt":"Premise: But when th' Union men came, they was thinkin' th' same 'bout Don Cazar.

He is a proud representative of the United States, competing on an international stage against some of the best athletes from around the world.

Despite his talents on the football field, Craigwell failed to make the cut and was left without a team. Rather than give up on his dream of being a professional athlete, Craigwell decided to explore other options. It was at this point that he discovered rugby sevens. Rugby sevens is a form of rugby union in which teams consist of seven players instead of the traditional 15. The matches are fast-paced and action-packed, with players needing to be agile, quick, and skilled in both offense and defense. Craigwell quickly embraced the sport and began to excel. He was soon a key part of the United States rugby sevens team, helping the squad to achieve victories against some of the world's best teams. This January, the U.S. will welcome the sevens circuit to Las Vegas. The tournament will feature teams from around the world, with Craigwell and his teammates ready to showcase their skills and compete for victory. For Craigwell, his journey from football to rugby sevens has been a success. He has found a new sport that he loves and has become an integral part of the U.S. rugby sevens team.

Scam mail costs victims £2.4bn a year.","completion":"The Costs of Junk mail and Scam mail Junk mail continues to be a significant contributor to Royal Mail's business, accounting for a quarter of its overall activity. However, its negative effects are being increasingly felt by consumers, who have to deal with the burden of receiving endless amounts of unsolicited mail. Not only is junk mail a nuisance, but it also has environmental costs, as it contributes to the production of unnecessary waste. Furthermore, there is the issue of scam mail, which costs victims £2.4bn a year in the UK alone. Scam mail is designed to deceive and exploit vulnerable individuals, often containing false promises and exaggerated claims. It can lead to substantial financial losses or identity theft, causing serious harm to those affected. As such, stricter regulations are needed to protect consumers from the harmful effects of junk mail and scam mail. The government has already introduced measures to tackle the issue, including the Mail Preference Service, which allows individuals to opt-out of receiving unsolicited mail. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly when it comes to identifying and prosecuting individuals or groups behind scam mail. In conclusion, the prevalence of junk mail and scam mail in our society is a cause for concern. It not only has negative environmental impacts but also causes financial harm and fear amongst vulnerable individuals. Therefore, more effective measures are required to prevent and prosecute these harmful activities, and to ensure that consumers can trust the postal service once again."},{"prompt":"Question: when does the new catfish season start 2018??

In 2012, a team of scientists from Johns Hopkins University published a genetic compression algorithm that does not use a reference genome for compression. HAPZIPPER was tailored for HapMap data and achieves over 20fold compression (95% reduction in file size), providing 2 to 4fold better compression and in much faster time than the leading generalpurpose compression utilities. For this, Chanda, Elhaik, and Bader introduced MAF based encoding (MAFE), which reduces the heterogeneity of the dataset by sorting SNPs by their minor allele frequency, thus homogenizing the dataset. Other algorithms in 2009 and 2013 (DNAZip and GenomeZip) have compression ratios of up to 1200fold—allowing 6 billion basepair diploid human genomes to be stored in 2.5 megabytes (relative to a reference genome or averaged over many genomes).

The youngster was immediately taken to the hospital and is expected to recover. Unfortunately, this incident is not uncommon in the area, as just recently, a nearby inlet was closed off after six shark attacks occurred in one weekend. This alarming trend is causing concern among locals and authorities as they strive to find a solution to this problem. The increase in shark attacks could be attributed to several factors, such as warmer ocean temperatures and the growing popularity of beach activities in the area. However, it is essential to note that these creatures play a vital role in maintaining the ocean's ecosystem, and their presence should be respected. As beachgoers, it is vital to be aware of the potential dangers and take necessary precautions, such as avoiding swimming at dawn and dusk when sharks are most active and always keeping an eye out for warning signs or flags. Furthermore, it is crucial for authorities to take measures to ensure the safety of beachgoers, such as increasing the number of patrol officers and investing in shark detection technology.

However, statistics show that when compared to European counterparts, British women tend to experience poorer health outcomes. This is a concerning trend as health experts caution that it is vital to pay attention to one’s overall health as it can significantly impact one’s quality of life in the long term. One significant area of concern is cancer. UK women have been found to have higher cancer mortality rates compared to other EU countries. This is partly due to lifestyle choices such as smoking and drinking, which increases the risk of cancer. Lack of access to early detection and treatment could also be contributing to the high mortality rates. Another aspect that is concerning is alcohol consumption. UK women have been known to drink more than their European counterparts, which has negative impacts on their health in the long run. Drinking too much can increase the likelihood of developing several health problems such as liver failure, heart disease, and even cancer. Lastly, UK women are also more likely to be obese than women in other EU countries. Obesity can lead to numerous health problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease, among others. It is essential to adopt a healthy diet and lifestyle to prevent obesity and other related health risks. In conclusion, although more than 75 per cent of British women believe that they are fit and healthy, statistics show that they tend to suffer worse health outcomes than European counterparts. This is concerning because long-term health problems can have a significant impact on quality of life.

Long before Namibia's independence from South Africa, SWAPO was of the opinion that the country should become officially monolingual, choosing this approach in contrast to that of its neighbour South Africa (which granted all 11 of its major languages official status), which was seen by them as a deliberate policy of ethnolinguistic fragmentation. Consequently, SWAPO instituted English as the sole official language of Namibia though only about 3% of the population speaks it as a home language. Its implementation is focused on the civil service, education and the broadcasting system. Some other languages have received semiofficial recognition by being allowed as medium of instruction in primary schools. It is expected of private schools to follow the same policy as state schools, and English language is a compulsory subject. As in other postcolonial African societies, the push for monolingual instruction and policy has resulted in a high rate of school dropouts and of individuals whose academic competence in any language is low.

The Baptists particularly allowed them active roles in congregations. By the mid19th century, northern Baptists tended to oppose slavery. As tensions increased, in 1844 the Home Mission Society refused to appoint a slaveholder as a missionary who had been proposed by Georgia.

Fill in the blank space from the tape, optional.","completion":"One way to add more depth and interest to your paintings is to create a textured background. There are many techniques you can use to achieve this effect, but a simple and effective method involves applying tape to intersecting points across the canvas and painting between the lines. To get started, gather your materials. You will need a canvas or other painting surface, painter’s tape, and paint in the colors of your choice. Begin by applying the tape to the canvas in a pattern that creates intersecting lines. You can use a ruler or other tool to help you create straight lines. Next, mix your paint colors. You can use a palette or mix the paint directly on your canvas. Apply the paint to the spaces between the tape lines, using a brush or other tool. You can experiment with different brush strokes and techniques to create different effects. Once you have painted between all of the tape lines, let the paint dry completely. Then, carefully remove the tape. You should be left with a textured background with clean lines where the tape was. If you want to fill in the blank space left by the tape, you can do so now. This step is optional, but it can help to create a more cohesive and polished look. You can use the same colors as before or mix new colors to fill in the spaces. Creating a textured background with tape is a simple and effective way to add interest to your paintings.

Hence, the relationship to the past is a present awareness of having been, which allows the past to exist in the present. The relationship to the future is the state of anticipating a potential possibility, task, or engagement. It is related to the human propensity for caring and being concerned, which causes being ahead of oneself when thinking of a pending occurrence. Therefore, this concern for a potential occurrence also allows the future to exist in the present. The present becomes an experience, which is qualitative instead of quantitative. Heidegger seems to think this is the way that a linear relationship with time, or temporal existence, is broken or transcended. We are not stuck in sequential time. We are able to remember the past and project into the future—we have a kind of random access to our representation of temporal existence; we can, in our thoughts, step out of (ecstasis) sequential time.","completion":"Title: \\"Martin Heidegger's Concept of Time and Temporal Existence\\""},{"prompt":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: If the medical treatment is free for local residents you will not have to pay","completion":"\\"If the medical treatment is free for local residents, you will not have to pay.\\""},{"prompt":"Electricity in the Richmond Metro area is provided by Dominion Virginia Power.

Karl Lachmann (1793–1851) greatly contributed to making this method famous, even though he did not invent it. The method takes its name from the word stemma.

This specific meaning shows the relationships of the surviving witnesses (the first known example of such a stemma, albeit with the name, dates from 1827). The family tree is also referred to as a cladogram. The method works from the principle that community of error implies community of origin. That is, if two witnesses have a number of errors in common, it may be presumed that they were derived from a common intermediate source, called a hyparchetype. Relations between the lost intermediates are determined by the same process, placing all extant manuscripts in a family tree or stemma codicum descended from a single archetype.

The Iraqi Foreign Ministry says he hopes the event will help improve the country's image. Plus, MME visits Basra and takes a look at the construction boom fueled by petrodollars.","completion":"Iraq, after a long period of turbulence and violence, is finally on the path to progress. One of the significant markers of this positivity is the country's hosting of the first Arab Summit since 1990 in Baghdad, the capital city. It marks a significant shift in Iraq's diplomatic relations and its national image. For years, Iraq was the seat of violence and conflicts, leading to several sanctions and restrictions imposed upon the country. However, with the gradual restoration of peace, Baghdad is now hosting the Arab Summit. The Iraqi Foreign Ministry has expressed optimism that the event will help reshape the country's international image and draw attention to its rebuilding and rehabilitation efforts. The summit is an opportunity for Iraq to restore its role in the Arab world as a mediator, peacemaker, and broker. In addition to the Arab Summit, Iraq has also been making strides in its economic sector. Petroleum exports are the backbone of the nation's economy, and the recent boom in the sector has attracted several investors and companies. One such example of Iraq's economic progress is Basra, which has become the hub of major construction projects fueled by petrodollar investments. The city, once riddled with issues like poor access to electricity and inadequate water supply, is now experiencing a significant transformation. The prosperity brought by petrodollars has brought new infrastructure development in the form of road networks, hospitals, luxury resorts, and much more. In conclusion, Iraq is gradually emerging from its violent past to steer itself towards progress on multiple fronts. The country's hosting of the Arab Summit is a welcome sign of Iraq's return to the diplomatic arena. Meanwhile, the economic progress in cities like Basra is also a promising indicator of Iraq's path to recovery. As Iraq continues to rebuild itself, it is imperative for the international community to support and aid in these rebuilding efforts."},{"prompt":"Which actor played the role of killer Max Cady in the 1991 film Cape Fear????","completion":"Robert De Niro."},{"prompt":"Generate a short summary this sentence: a u.s. multiagency investigation into the shooting death of a mexican teen by a border patrol agent in el paso , texas , centered wednesday on surveillance cameras that may provide evidence about the incident .","completion":"US authorities are investigating the shooting death of a Mexican teenager by a border patrol agent in Texas.

Damage to a German steel facility occurred during a DST transition in 1993, when a computer timing system linked to a radio time synchronization signal allowed molten steel to cool for one hour less than the required duration, resulting in spattering of molten steel when it was poured.

Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules, or manually adjust the devices' clocks.

They worked with slaveholders in the South to urge a paternalistic institution. Both denominations made direct appeals to slaves and free blacks for conversion.

The efforts of this scholasticism were focused on applying Aristotelian logic and thoughts about natural processes to biblical passages and attempting to prove the viability of those passages through reason.

Dementia is a progressive, degenerative disease that affects a person's ability to remember, communicate, and interact with others, and is often linked to aging. To address this growing concern, healthcare providers may begin administering brief memory quizzes to patients during routine office visits. This screening process could help identify individuals who may be at risk for dementia, allowing for earlier diagnosis and treatment. While the idea of memory quizzes may seem unorthodox to some, researchers have found that simple assessments can be effective in identifying potential cognitive impairments. Patients may be asked to repeat a list of words or perform a task, such as drawing a clock face. These assessments can be completed quickly and are non-invasive. If patients do have concerns about their memory or overall cognitive health, they can then be referred to a specialist for further evaluation. Early diagnosis of dementia can lead to improved quality of life for both the patient and their families, as well as help to reduce the burden on the healthcare system. Overall, the move to prioritize tackling dementia by David Cameron and the implementation of simple memory quizzes in primary care settings may be instrumental in addressing the growing prevalence of this debilitating condition."},{"prompt":"wo small planes collided sunday in midair and crashed just off shore in malibu , california , killing all three people aboard .

In the Late Empire and Middle Ages Vergilius was spelled Virgilius. Two explanations are commonly given for this alteration. One deduces a false etymology associated with the word virgo (maiden in Latin) due to Virgil's excessive, maidenlike modesty. Alternatively, some argue that Vergilius was altered to Virgilius by analogy with the Latin virga (wand) due to the magical or prophetic powers attributed to Virgil in the Middle Ages (this explanation is found in only a handful of manuscripts, however, and was probably not widespread). In Norman schools (following the French practice), the habit was to anglicize Latin names by dropping their Latin endings, hence Virgil. In the 19th century, some Germantrained classicists in the United States suggested modification to Vergil, as it is closer to his original name, and is also the traditional German spelling.[citation needed] Modern usage permits both, though the Oxford guide to style recommends Vergilius to avoid confusion with the 8thcentury grammarian Virgilius Maro Grammaticus.

In 1972 the team relocated to Kansas City, Missouri, and was renamed the Kansas CityOmaha Kings because it initially split its home games between Kansas City and Omaha, Nebraska.

Some of these passes have been long bombs that travel over 60 yards in the air, while others have been short dump-offs that are caught near the line of scrimmage and taken in for the score. So, how many yards difference is there between the longest and shortest touchdown passes in NFL history? Well, the answer to this question is not a straightforward one. There have been so many touchdown passes thrown over the years, and the length of these passes varies greatly. Additionally, the shortest touchdown pass ever thrown is difficult to pinpoint, as many touchdowns have been scored on interceptions or fumbles, in which case the distance of the \\"pass\\" is zero. That being said, we can still look at some of the longest touchdown passes ever thrown and compare them to some of the shorter ones. According to NFL.com, the longest touchdown pass in NFL history was thrown by Tom Brady in 2011. In a game against the Dolphins, Brady launched a 99-yard bomb to wide receiver Wes Welker for the score. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there have been countless one-yard touchdown passes thrown throughout the years. It's difficult to pinpoint the shortest one ever thrown, but many quarterbacks have tossed short passes to their tight ends or fullbacks in goal-line situations. So, if we take Brady's 99-yard touchdown pass as the longest and a one-yard touchdown pass as the shortest, there is a 98-yard difference between the two. Of course, this is not an exact answer, as there have likely been shorter touchdown passes thrown in NFL history. However, it does give us a good estimate of the difference between the longest and shortest touchdown passes we've seen so far."},{"prompt":"Write an article based on this summary: Don't pick up a dachshund by his upper body.

Write the greeting just below the date but on the left-hand side. This could be as simple as \\"Dear [Recipient's Name],\\" or you could choose a more personal greeting if you prefer. Begin your first sentence below the greeting. This is where you can express your gratitude and thank the recipient for whatever they did for you. Be specific about what you're thanking them for and how much you appreciate it. Write your thank you message. This is the main body of your note, where you can go into more detail about why you're grateful and how their actions impacted you. Be sincere and heartfelt in your message. Close your note with a closing. This could be \\"Sincerely,\\" \\"With gratitude,\\" \\"Warmly,\\" or any other closing that feels appropriate. Sign your name below the closing. Close the card and slide it into the envelope. Address the card to your recipient, making sure to use the correct spelling and address. Apply your return address label and stamp, then mail the thank you note. By taking the time to write a thank you note, you're showing the recipient that their kindness or gift mattered to you. It's a small gesture that can have a big impact and can help strengthen relationships. So, next time you have the opportunity to write a thank you note, follow these simple steps and spread some gratitude."},{"prompt":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: The Waterman eatType pub; The Waterman food Fast food; The Waterman customer rating high; The Waterman area riverside","completion":"The Waterman is a rustic eatType pub situated in a picturesque riverside area where you can grab some delicious fast food that has earned a high customer rating."},{"prompt":"Next question: who won the gold medal in men's snowboarding?","completion":"I am sorry, I do not have information on the specific event you are referring to.
