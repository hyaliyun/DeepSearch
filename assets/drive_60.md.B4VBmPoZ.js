Question: What happens at the beginning of a meeting? Context: Meetings for worship and study are held at Kingdom Halls, which are typically functional in character, and do not contain religious symbols. Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose \\"territory\\" they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as \\"meetings\\" as scheduled by congregation elders. The meetings are largely devoted to study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible. The format of the meetings is established by the religion's headquarters, and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide. Congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours, typically gathering mid-week (three meetings) and on the weekend (two meetings). Prior to 2009, congregations met three times each week; these meetings were condensed, with the intention that members dedicate an evening for \\"family worship\\". Gatherings are opened and closed with kingdom songs (hymns) and brief prayers. Twice each year, Witnesses from a number of congregations that form a \\"circuit\\" gather for a one-day assembly. Larger groups of congregations meet once a year for a three-day \\"regional convention\\", usually at rented stadiums or auditoriums. Their most important and solemn event is the commemoration of the \\"Lord's Evening Meal\\", or \\"Memorial of Christ's Death\\" on the date of the Jewish Passover.

Mark was really good at running, so good that he got to go to a big event called the Rio Olympics! At the Olympics, people from all over the world come together to play sports and see who is the best. Mark was going to run in a race called the 800 meters. That's a race where you run around a big track twice as fast as you can. Only the best runners get to run in the Olympics, so Mark was very happy and excited to be there. In the race, Mark had to run against other fast runners, including a man named David Rudisha from a country called Kenya. David was very fast too, and he was the champion from the last Olympics. That means he won the gold medal and was the best runner in the whole world! When the race started, all the runners began to run as fast as they could. Mark tried his best, but he wasn't as fast as David Rudisha and some other runners. Mark couldn't do something amazing and win the race, so he had to stop running in the competition. The race was won by David Rudisha, who was very happy to be the champion again. Even though Mark didn't win, he was still very proud of himself for being able to run in the Olympics. He knew that it was a big accomplishment just to be there, and he promised himself that he would keep practicing, get faster, and try again at the next Olympics. And all the people in Letterkenny cheered for Mark, because they knew how hard he had worked and how important it was to never give up.

Step 2: Consider potential outcomes of the government's actions - If the government does not redraft estimates without legislative approval, it will not be committing the acts the opposition reproaches them for. - If the government follows this suggestion, it will be in line with the opposition's criticism.

Here is a premise: Nothing could more aptly epitomize the Mutiny's good and bad results, from an Indian point of view, than the name given to the legislation that was to the 1858 Act for Better Government of India. Here is a hypothesis: The Better Government did, ultimately, make India a better place to live. Here are the options: OPT: (i) yes; (ii) it is not possible to tell; (iii) no; Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine if the hypothesis follows from the premise, it is important to first analyze both the premise and hypothesis in detail and then consider the available options. The premise asserts that the 1858 Act for the Better Government of India epitomizes both the good and bad results of the Mutiny from an Indian point of view. As a historical background, the Indian Mutiny, also known as the First War of Indian Independence or the Indian Rebellion of 1857, was a result of several political, social, and economic grievances, culminating in widespread uprisings against the British colonial authority. In response to the Mutiny, the British government enacted the 1858 Act, which abolished the British East India Company's rule and established direct governance under the British Crown. The hypothesis posits that the Better Government did eventually make India a better place to live. This statement assumes that the 1858 Act ultimately led to an improvement in living conditions, marked by greater prosperity, welfare, and social harmony in India. Given the available options (yes, it is not possible to tell, no), we will now examine whether the premise compels the truth of the hypothesis: Option (i) - Yes: If we are to accept this option, we must find strong supporting evidence that the 1858 Act directly led to an improvement in living conditions in India. While there were some positive developments under the colonial government, they were often accompanied by exploitation, economic stagnation, and a lack of focus on the welfare of the Indian population. Therefore, it is difficult to unequivocally assert that the Better Government made India a better place to live. Option (ii) - It is not possible to tell: This option stresses the ambiguity of the relationship between the 1858 Act and the improvement in living conditions in India. The complex consequences of colonial governance and the numerous intervening factors make it challenging to definitively conclude that the Better Government resulted in a better India. This option acknowledges the inherent limitations of grasping the full implications of a historical event. Option (iii) - No: This option would be appropriate if there is evidence that contradicts the hypothesis. While there were negative aspects of colonial rule, such as economic exploitation and racism, this option would only be suitable if the 1858 Act had exclusively or predominantly led to adverse outcomes. Based on the above analysis, it appears that the most appropriate answer is option (ii) - it is not possible to tell. The premise does not conclusively support the hypothesis due to the complex and multifaceted nature of the relationship between the 1858 Act and the improvement of living conditions in India. The outcomes of the Better Government are a combination of both positive and negative impacts, and as a result, it is difficult to ascertain whether the hypothesis is necessarily true given the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rodents can squeeze through small gaps and cracks, so make sure to seal up any openings you find. Common entry points include gaps around doors, windows, and vents. Step 2: Seal up any gaps and cracks Use materials like steel wool, caulk, or spray foam to seal any gaps or cracks you find during the inspection. Make sure to also check less visible areas like basement and attic. Step 3: Maintain cleanliness Regularly clean your home, as a clean and clutter-free environment is less attractive to rodents. Vacuum floors, wipe countertops, and take out the trash to minimize food sources for rodents. Step 4: Properly store food Make sure to store food in sealed containers, and clean up any spilled food immediately. Don't leave pet food out overnight, as it can also attract rodents. Step 5: Eliminate potential rodent habitats Remove debris, woodpiles, and clutter from around your home’s exterior to minimize potential nesting sites. Trim trees and shrubs to prevent rodents from climbing and gaining access to your home. Step 6: Dispose of garbage properly Keep garbage in sturdy, sealed containers and take it out regularly to avoid attracting rodents. Step 7: Install screens on vents and chimneys Installing screens on vents and chimney openings will help prevent rodents from entering your home through these points. Step 8: Set up traps or use rodenticides If you suspect a rodent infestation, set up traps, or use rodenticides according to the product label. Make sure to place them in areas where rodents are likely to travel and keep them out of reach of children and pets. Step 9: Consider professional help If you're struggling to keep rodents away despite taking preventive measures, consider hiring a professional pest control service to help you eliminate the problem.

[ii] no.","completion":"[i] Yes. The sentence \\"In 1978, the Supreme Court ruled in Bakke v. Regents that public universities (and other government institutions) could not set specific numerical targets based on race for admissions or employment.\\" does provide a valid answer to the question \\"What are public universities not allowed to do?\\" To further elaborate and provide additional context to the sentence, let us consider the Bakke v. Regents case and the ruling regarding public universities' admissions and employment practices. In the landmark case of Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978), the United States Supreme Court confronted the issue of affirmative action in higher education. Allan Bakke, a white applicant, sued the Regents of the University of California after being denied admission to the University of California, Davis, Medical School. Bakke argued that the school's admission policy, which reserved 16 of the 100 available seats for minority students, violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court's decision in Bakke was deeply divided. The Court held that the university's use of strict racial quotas in its admission policy was unconstitutional. However, in a separate opinion by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., the Court acknowledged that race could be considered among other factors in a university's admissions process. Powell's opinion clarified that pursuing diversity within the student body was a compelling interest, making it permissible for universities to use race-conscious policies. As a result of the Bakke decision, public universities and other government institutions are not allowed to set specific numerical targets or quotas based on race for admissions or employment. However, they are allowed to implement affirmative action programs that take race into consideration as one of many factors in a holistic review of an applicant's qualifications. Subsequent Supreme Court cases have further refined the parameters within which race-conscious policies and affirmative action programs may be implemented. The Court has emphasized the importance of individualized, holistic review and has required institutions to demonstrate that race-neutral alternatives would not be sufficient for achieving their diversity objectives. In summary, the sentence mentioned provides a valid answer to the question about public universities' limitations by stating that they cannot set specific numerical targets based on race for admissions or employment, as determined by the Supreme Court ruling in Bakke v. Regents. However, public universities are allowed to consider race as one of many factors in a holistic review process, and the pursuit of diversity within the student body remains a compelling interest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The Game is both infinitely simple and ridiculously complex. Also, you lost again, if you're still reading. The rules to the Game are as follows: Everyone in the world is playing the Game, whether they know it or not. If you think about the Game, you lose the Game. This includes things like desperately trying not to think about the Game, or being tipped off by anyone else talking about losing the Game, or any split-second that the Game randomly pops into your mind. You think about it, you lose. When you lose, you have to announce that you lost. It can be out loud, on the Internet, in writing, or in any number of other ways. Announcing your losses is the only way that the Game is played. Nobody ever wins the game, you can only avoid losing and attempt to make other people lose by spreading the word about the Game. If you're in the Game to win, you're going to lose. If you're in the Game to lose, congratulations! Ironic processing is the psychological phenomenon that describes the inverse relationship between a desire to avoid thoughts and the persistence of those thoughts. In other words, the more you want to stop thinking about the Game, the more you're thinking about the Game. This is also sometimes called the \\"white bear phenomenon,\\" based on a reference in Tolstoy, or the \\"pink elephant phenomenon.\\" The act of deciding to not think about something makes you think about something. Ironic processing was used to humorous effect in the first Ghostbusters movie, in which the Ghostbusters were told that whatever they thought of would come to destroy them. Despite attempts to clear their minds entirely, someone thinks of the Stay-Puff'd marshmallow man, who arrives in monster-form to destroy Manhattan. Some people play the Game slightly differently, giving players a grace period after losing before you can lose again, or are not required to announce it for a certain period of time. This time can range from a few seconds to half an hour or so. Others put restrictions on ways that a loss can be announced. If you're playing with some friends, decide on winnable rules, if you want. Some may say that death can also end the Game, while others say that the Game will end when the British Prime Minister, President of the United States, or the Pope says the Game is lost on national television. Still others believe that the Game can only be won when someone knocks the hat off the Pope. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"The article discusses \\"the Game,\\" an ongoing, unwinnable mental game played by people worldwide. The rules dictate that when a participant thinks about the Game, they lose and must announce their loss. The more one tries not to think about the Game, the more likely they are to think about it, due to the ironic processing phenomenon. Variations in rules exist, including grace periods and restrictions on loss announcements. Some believe the Game can be won through specific actions, such as a high-ranking official publicly announcing a loss or knocking the hat off the Pope."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people. - Richard Tiffany Gere (; born August 31, 1949) is an American actor and humanitarian activist. He began acting in the 1970s, playing a supporting role in \\"Looking for Mr. Goodbar\\" and a starring role in \\"Days of Heaven\\". He came to prominence in 1980 for his role in the film \\"American Gigolo\\", which established him as a leading man and a sex symbol. He went on to star in several hit films, including \\"An Officer and a Gentleman\\", \\"Pretty Woman\\", \\"Primal Fear\\", \\"Runaway Bride\\", \\"Arbitrage\\" and \\"Chicago\\", for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor and a Screen Actors Guild Award for part of the Best Cast. - Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drama\\"), which is derived from \\"to do\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drao\\"). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory. - In ordinary language, a crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority. The term \\"crime\\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or offence (or criminal offence) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\\"a public wrong\\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - An Officer and a Gentleman is a 1982 American romantic drama film starring Richard Gere, Debra Winger and Louis Gossett, Jr., who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the film, and was produced by Lorimar Productions for Paramount Pictures. It tells the story of Zack (Gere), a U.S. Navy Aviation Officer Candidate who is beginning his training at Aviation Officer Candidate School. While Zack meets his first true girlfriend during his training, a local young woman named Paula (Winger), he also comes into conflict with the hard-driving Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant (Gossett, Jr.), the drill instructor training his class. - American Gigolo is a 1980 American crime drama film starring Richard Gere , written and directed by Paul Schrader .

She came home crying on her first day because she got in trouble. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? emma likes to learn","completion":"Given the preceding text, it is not clear whether Emma likes to learn or not. The text provided primarily focuses on Emma's first day of school and her emotional experience relating to feeling scared and getting into trouble, rather than her feelings towards learning or her academic interests. It is natural for young children like Emma to feel uncomfortable and scared on the first day in a new environment. Her fear might have distracted her from following the teacher's instruction to put her things in the cubby, which led to her getting into trouble. This, however, does not necessarily indicate her disinterest in learning or her overall school experience. It could be that once she becomes more familiar and comfortable in the school environment, she will begin to enjoy the process of learning and participating in various academic and extracurricular activities. To make a definite statement about Emma liking to learn, additional information about her enthusiasm towards various subjects, her performance at school, or even her willingness to do homework and engage in informative discussions would be required. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Emma likes to learn\\" could potentially follow the given text, but without further context or information to support this assertion, it seems unrelated to the emotional roller coaster of Emma's first day at school as described in the text."},{"prompt":"Question: The gambler had been winning a lot, he wisely decided to what?

Over the past few years, I have made a habit of asking my fellow Africans from different countries what they think would have been the lot of our continent if the slave traders and colonisers had never set foot here. Some suggest that African societies would have eventually evolved, gradually catching up with the rest of the world in terms of development. Others insist that Africa was already at the same level of development as the rest of the world, but that slavery and colonialism interrupted and stunted our growth. Some others believe that we Africans would have wiped ourselves out with tribal wars and conquests and that the continent would have become a vast space with the few surviving ethnic groups spread out far from one another. I like to imagine that we Africans would have eventually, in the fullness of time, sorted ourselves out. We would have discovered electricity and gravity; we would have invented air conditioners and refrigerators and we would have wondered what lay across the vast oceans, then sent men and women in ships to find out. It may have taken many decades, it may have taken centuries, but African societies would have eventually made their way towards what is known as \\"first world\\" status. I also imagine that, at some point, an African would have thought, \\"My hair is tightly curled and beautiful. But I wonder what it might look like when straightened. \\"What if my hair were blue instead of black? What if yellow or red? What if gold?\\" Such an African could then have gone on to invent hair relaxers and dye, despite never having seen a Caucasian with straight, blond hair. It would have been less about \\"trying to look like white people\\" and more about creativity, a quest for options. Africans may also have contemplated the possibility of switching skin colour. \\"Some of us are dark-skinned and beautiful; some are light-skinned and equally beautiful. What if the dark can become light and vice versa?\\" The first set of \\"bleaching creams\\" manufactured may have been carcinogenic. But eventually, an African scientist, unhindered by any guilty feelings around helping \\"black women make themselves look like white people\\", would have perfected a bleaching cream that was not dangerous. He may even have received a much-needed government grant to further his research. African women would then have been free to alter the colour of their skin without any adverse health effects. Many of the Nigerian women I know who use skin-lightening products are not necessarily originally dark-skinned. They are already light-skinned women who want to reinforce what they already have. Think of a butcher sharpening his knife or a Naomi Campbell wearing high heels. Some of these women bleach their skin only a few weeks before a big event, such as a society wedding. They know that there will be a crowd of guests and they intend to stand out. Therefore they purchase the most eye-catching jewellery and clothing, and don the most elaborate pompadours. Being light-skinned is a natural stand-out factor in a society where the majority of people have dark skin. By bleaching their skin, these women also aim to \\"glow in the dark\\". Nigeria's infamous 419 scammers of the 1990s had a reputation for flashy lifestyles. They drove the biggest cars, wore the most flamboyant clothing, and built the most ostentatious houses. Many of them also tended to prefer being seen in the company of light-skinned girlfriends and wives, women whose complexions \\"flashed\\". Females eager to benefit from the scammers' largesse began bleaching their skin. Skin lightening became simply a tool for fetching a wealthy man. Almost every year, a fresh debate erupts in the media around bleached skin and other alterations to appearance that African women embark upon. I suspect that this year will not be different. This topic will once again make the rounds. One of my New Year wishes is that accusations of \\"wanting to be like white people\\" or \\"being ashamed of being black\\" will not drown out whatever else Africans around the world have to say regarding the various choices they make. What if there were no-one else in the world but Africa and Africans? It is within that premise that I would prefer to see the debates tackled.

Bolten watched the exchanges and, after what he called \\"a quiet moment,\\"suggested that the Vice President get in touch with the President and confirm the engage order. Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order. He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President. The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to \\"engage or \\"take out\\" the aircraft. At 10:33, Hadley told the air threat conference call: \\"I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are there's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out. The Vice President's guidance was we need to take them out.\\" Once again, there was no immediate information about the fate of the inbound aircraft. In the apt description of one witness, \\"It drops below the radar screen and it's just continually hovering in your imagination; you don't know where it is or what happens to it.\\" Eventually, the shelter received word that the alleged hijacker 5 miles away had been a medevac helicopter.

In fact, washing jeans too often can cause them to fade prematurely. You really only need to machine wash jeans once ever 4 to 6 weeks. If you notice any stains during this time frame, you can spot clean with household cleaners rather than throwing the jeans in the wash. If you're up to it, washing jeans by hand can be more gentle on them than machine washing. This should be a standard practice each time you throw a pair of jeans in with the laundry. Turning the jeans inside out will prevent detergent from wearing as harshly on the dye. Jeans washed inside out will maintain more of their color. If you notice your jeans seem to fade a bit with each wash, use a color protectant detergent. You can buy this at most supermarkets or department stores. You can also opt not to use detergent at all. Vinegar can be used as replacement and may better preserve the color of your jeans. Detergent is meant to eliminate stains but often does not differentiate between stains and dye. Vinegar, on the other hand, will make for a milder wash, cleaning your jeans without removing dye. Vinegar has a strong smell, however. If you have a sensitive nose, using vinegar may be a bad idea. Jeans tend to fade less when washed with other dark clothing. Dark dyes can fade in the wash and swirl around with other clothes. If clothing is packed in together, less dye will fade out. Wait until you have a lot of dark clothes that need washing before washing your jeans. Jeans require a gentle wash and low temperatures to prevent fading. Set your washer for the slowest spin cycle possible and the lowest temperature water. If there's an option for a gentle wash or a hand wash on your washing machine, use it. Summary:","completion":"To maintain color and prevent fading, wash jeans less frequently, inside out, with color-protectant detergent or vinegar, and use gentle cycles with low-temperature water."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: when did world war 2 start in china?","completion":"World War 2 is commonly considered to have started in Europe with the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939; however, the conflict between China and Japan that eventually consolidated into the broader war began earlier. This Sino-Japanese conflict, which was later assimilated into World War 2, began on July 7, 1937. To understand the origins of this conflict, it is helpful to delve into the historical background of the events leading up to it. In September 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria, a region in northeastern China, following the Mukden Incident. The invasion led to the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo, controlled by Japan the following year. The League of Nations condemned this aggressive move, prompting Japan to withdraw from the international organization in 1933. Meanwhile, the tensions between Japan and China continued to escalate, with incidents of armed skirmishes occurring frequently along their borders. On July 7, 1937, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident took place near Beijing when a minor clash between Chinese and Japanese troops quickly spiraled out of control. This event marked the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War. As the conflict escalated, the Japanese forces launched a full-scale invasion of China, rapidly occupying key cities, including Shanghai and the capital, Nanjing (then spelled Nanking). The Nanjing Massacre, also known as the Rape of Nanking, occurred in December 1937, when the invading Japanese army murdered, raped, and brutalized tens of thousands of Chinese civilians. During the course of the war, both sides experienced significant casualties. The Chinese endured prolonged Japanese aggression as well as internal strife, as the Communist and Nationalist factions within the country temporarily joined forces to resist the invasion. The war in China was not limited to conventional military confrontations; guerilla warfare, terrorism, and acts of sabotage were commonplace throughout the conflict. The Second Sino-Japanese War merged with World War 2 as Japan increased its level of aggression in the region. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 forced the United States to enter the war, marking the beginning of the Pacific War that eventually led to the downfall of the Japanese Empire. The conflict in China continued until the end of World War 2. The official defeat of Japan came on September 2, 1945, with their formal surrender. The Chinese Civil War between the Communist and Nationalist factions resumed shortly thereafter, ultimately leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China by the Communist Party in 1949, and the retreat of the Nationalist government to Taiwan. In conclusion, the start of World War 2 in China can be traced back to the Marco Polo Bridge Incident on July 7, 1937, which marked the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War. This conflict eventually merged with the broader global war, becoming an integral part of the fight against Axis powers. The war in China had immense implications for the country's political and social landscape, setting the stage for its contemporary historical trajectory."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I walked inside past the front lobby. I could tell the desk manager wanted to hassle me, but he was too busy arguing with a middle-aged peroxide-blonde woman in a leopard-print top. Her skin was leathery and weather beaten, and I guessed she was the type who was actually a good ten years younger than she looked. I made my way up the narrow staircase that smelled of urine and bleach, going all the way to the third floor. I continued down the dimly lit hallway, past a series of closed doors that muffled the sounds of women faking moans of pleasure. Room 313 was down at the far end of the hall, and its door was already slightly ajar. I knocked anyways, but there was no answer. Pushing the door open just enough to poke my head in, I called, \\"Hello? Is anybody in there?\\" There was no response, so I went in and felt along the wall for the light switch. A single weak bulb came on, lighting up the tiny, sparse room with a dim yellow glow. The room was about 8 feet by 8 feet, and the only furniture was a dingy, unmade bed and a metal foot locker. There were no windows, no closet, and no bathroom. As I stepped all the way in, I noticed a wooden baseball bat propped up beside the door. My watch said 6:20 - twenty minutes late for the interview. I sat on the edge of the bed to wait, hoping that maybe my contact had just stepped out momentarily. After a few minutes, a phone started ringing out in the hallway.

The equation is: 329 + 489 = -232*d - 177*d When we add 329 and 489, we get: 818 = -232*d - 177*d Now, we need to combine the terms with \\"d\\" in them. To do this, we add -232*d and -177*d together: 818 = -409*d Now, we need to find the value of \\"d\\".

Article:","completion":"Title: Exploring Our Emotions: A Guide for Little Learners Hey little friends, today we are going to talk about something very interesting and important - emotions! Emotions are the feelings we have inside us. They help us understand how we feel about different things happening around us. Let's learn about some common emotions and what they feel like! 1. Anger Imagine when someone takes away your favorite toy without asking, and you really want to play with it. That feeling inside you that makes your face turn red and your heart beat faster is called anger. It's okay to feel angry sometimes, but remember to always share your feelings with a grown-up and take deep breaths to calm down. 2. Disgust Have you ever been given a plate of food with something on it that you really don't like? Like a super yucky vegetable? That feeling of \\"eww\\" and wanting to push the plate away is disgust. It's your way of saying \\"I don't like that thing!\\" 3. Fear Remember when it's dark and you hear a strange sound, and you think there might be a monster hiding under your bed? That feeling of being scared is called fear. Fear helps to protect us from things that might be dangerous, but sometimes we can feel fear even when there's nothing to worry about. It helps to have a cuddle with someone you love, or even sing a brave song to help chase the fear away. 4. Happiness Happiness is a bright and joyful emotion that we feel when something good happens to us or when we are having lots of fun. It's like when you're playing with your friends, or you get a surprise treat you love. Happiness makes us smile and giggle, and it makes our hearts feel warm and cozy. 5. Sadness Sometimes things happen that make us feel down and upset. Maybe you dropped your ice-cream on the ground, or you have to say goodbye to a friend who's moving away. That feeling you get when you want to cry and your heart feels heavy is called sadness. It's okay to be sad sometimes, just remember to talk to someone about it and give yourself some extra love to help feel better. 6. Surprise Surprise is the feeling you get when something unexpected happens. This can be a good surprise like an exciting birthday party, or a not-so-good surprise, like a loud thunderstorm! Your heart might jump a little, and your eyes might open wide. Surprises can be both fun and scary, but they always keep life interesting! So, there you have it, little learners! Understanding our emotions can help us explain how we feel to others and make better choices about what we do. Remember, it's always important to share your emotions with a grown-up or someone you trust, so they can help too. Now, go out and explore your own emotions and know that it's perfectly normal to feel all these different feelings!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To prevent moisture rings from appearing on your table,","completion":"Preventing moisture rings from appearing on your table involves a combination of proactive measures, proper cleaning techniques, and maintenance routines. In order to effectively protect your table and preserve its appearance, consider the following steps: 1. Use coasters: One of the simplest and most effective ways to prevent moisture rings is by using coasters. Choose coasters made of materials that can absorb moisture, such as cork or fabric, to protect your table from condensation. Ensure that every guest has a coaster and remind them to use it for all drinks. 2. Tablecloths and placemats: Covering your table with a waterproof tablecloth or placemats can protect the surface from spills and moisture, helping to prevent the formation of moisture rings. Ensure that the tablecloth or placemat is easy to clean and maintain. 3. Proper glassware: Sometimes condensation can form on certain types of glassware, such as those with poor insulation qualities. Invest in double-walled glassware or insulated mugs to minimize the chances of condensation forming on the glass and causing moisture rings on your table. 4. Maintain a consistent room temperature: Extreme temperature fluctuations can cause condensation to form on cold surfaces, such as glassware. To minimize this, try to maintain a consistent room temperature so that the surfaces in the room do not experience drastic changes in temperature. 5. Wipe up spills immediately: Accidental spills can lead to moisture rings or other damage. If a spill occurs, clean it up immediately using a soft, absorbent cloth. This can help prevent moisture from seeping into the table surface and causing damage. 6. Use trivets for hot dishes: The heat from hot dishes can cause condensation to form on the table surface, resulting in moisture rings. Use trivets, hot pads, or heat-resistant mats to protect your table from the heat of hot dishes. 7. Regularly clean and maintain your table: To keep your table free from moisture rings and other damage, clean it regularly using a mild soap solution and a soft cloth. Be sure to dry the table thoroughly after cleaning. Additionally, apply furniture polish or wax occasionally to seal the surface and protect it from moisture penetration. 8. Protect your table from humidity: High humidity levels can lead to moisture condensing on surfaces, which can result in the formation of moisture rings. Use a dehumidifier, air conditioner, or ensure proper ventilation in areas where your table is located to keep humidity levels in check. 9. Choose the right table material: Some materials are more susceptible to moisture damage than others. When purchasing a table, opt for materials like solid wood or laminate, which are less prone to moisture damage compared to soft woods, veneers, or particleboard. 10. Repair existing moisture rings: If you already have existing moisture rings on your table, repair them as soon as possible to prevent further damage. You can use a mild abrasive cleaner, such as toothpaste, to gently remove the moisture ring. For more severe cases, consider consulting a professional furniture restorer for advice on the appropriate repair methods. By following these steps, you can effectively prevent moisture rings from appearing on your table, preserving its appearance and ensuring that it remains in good condition for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance.

It shows you how to thread the needle, double the thread for strength, and sew the seam step by step. This is the correct way to mend a pillowcase seam by hand. Wrong Answer: Gather the pillow case edge by edge and fold it over so the rip doesn't show, or use a dark colored dye to conceal it. If the pillow case is now too small, you can shorten the pillow a bit so it will still fit. Explanation: This option is a quick fix but it does not actually sew or mend the pillowcase seam. Folding and dyeing does not provide a long-lasting solution, and cutting a pillow to fit a smaller size is not efficient. This option is not the correct way to mend a pillowcase seam by hand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Jennifer stores her bread in the cupboard when she gets home from the grocery store since she thinks it tastes better that way. Martha grew up in a household that always kept their bread in the freezer so that's what she does with her bread. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which woman's bread will grow mold slower? Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster. The same principle explains why storing food in a cold refrigerator reduces the rate at which food spoils (see Figure below ). Both food frying and food spoiling are chemical reactions that happen faster at higher temperatures. The answer is:","completion":"Martha's bread will grow mold slower because she stores her bread in the freezer. Lower temperatures slow down the chemical reactions involved in mold growth, since the particles of reactants have less energy and move slower, decreasing the likelihood and intensity of collisions. Storing food in a cold environment, like Martha does with her bread in the freezer, reduces the rate at which food spoils, as opposed to storing it in a cupboard like Jennifer does, where the temperature would be higher and mold growth would occur more quickly."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Two revolutionary movements started to develop in the beginning of the 1870s: the Internal Revolutionary Organisation and the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee. Their armed struggle reached its peak with the April Uprising which broke out in 1876. It resulted in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, and led to the foundation of the third Bulgarian state after the Treaty of San Stefano. The treaty set up a Principality Bulgaria which territory included the wide area between the Danube and the Balkan mountain range, most of today Eastern Serbia, Northern Thrace, parts of Eastern Thrace and nearly all of Macedonia. At that time the clergy's shifts from the Orthodox to the Catholic Church and vice versa were symptomatic of the foreign powers' game that the clergy got involved after the 1878 Berlin Treaty, that partitioned the stipulated territory of the new Principality. Thus, in the interplay between the Orthodox and the Uniat doctrine, Bulgaria supported the Orthodox Exarchate. Russia supported Bulgaria. The Greek Patriarchate of Constantinople supported the Greek national idea. France and the Habsburg Empire supported the Uniats. The Ottoman Empire's attitude was depending on how it had to balance its own interests in the game with the Great Powers.

Choose glasses that display your love for fashion. Article:","completion":"Title: Choosing Eyewear: A Strategic Approach to Enhancing Your Wardrobe Introduction: Glasses don't just serve a functional purpose – correcting vision. They have evolved into an indispensable fashion accessory that tells a story about your personality, style, and attitude. Just like the nuances of your wardrobe, your eyewear can also reflect your lifestyle, whether you're a professional, a sports enthusiast, a parent, or a fashion aficionado. This article will guide you on how to select glasses that match your wardrobe style and cater to your specific needs. The Professional Look: Whether in a boardroom meeting or participating in a virtual work conference, your eyewear can enhance your professional image. Those who want to project a more sober and sophisticated image may consider frames in classic shapes (like round or rectangular) and neutral colors such as black, brown, or silver. Professional doesn't mean boring, however. If your work environment encourages individual expressions of style, you might opt for more daring frames that blend with your professional outfits. For example, blue frames could complement a navy suit, while tortoiseshell frames can give you that quintessential intellectual look, perfect for professionals within academia or creative fields. Try experimenting with shapes and subtle accents, like delicate metalwork or contrasting temples, to add a hint of character to your persona. Eyewear for an Active Lifestyle: For those who live an active lifestyle, choosing eyewear is not just about aesthetics but majorly about comfort and durability. If you regularly participate in sports or outdoor activities, consider sport glasses. They are typically constructed with lightweight, flexible materials like polycarbonate or TR90 nylon that can withstand high impact. Wrap-around frames are a popular choice for fitness buffs for their snug fit. These glasses often come with features like non-slip nose grips and temple tips that provide much-needed stability during strenuous activities. If you are a swimmer or cyclist, prescription goggles or glasses with interchangeable lenses could be your best bet. Parenthood and Purposeful Eyewear: Parents are always on the go, and they need eyewear that can keep up with them. Durability is key here. Choose glasses with flexible frames that can endure toddler yanks and baby grips. Frame materials like Titanium or Stainless Steel make a great choice for their strength and longevity. Consider also opting for lenses that are scratch-resistant and have an anti-reflective coating—a small but beneficial feature when you're multi-tasking or up for late-night feedings. Speaking of Fashion: Lastly, but certainly very important, is the fashion angle. For those who consider their eyewear as the ultimate reflection of their fashion sense, the sky's the limit. Merge fashion trends with your personal style by experimenting with frame shapes, colors, patterns, and details. Consider a bold cat-eye or a trendy oversized frame in a bold hue or distinctive pattern for a statement look. Depending on the season, transparent frames, pastel shades, or glasses with floral or tortoise shell patterns might be in vogue. Conclusion: Everyone's eyeglasses choice will be as unique as their individual lifestyle. It's worth remembering that not every style, material, or design fits everyone, so you should consider not only your wardrobe but also your lifestyle, comfort, and purpose while selecting eyewear. Remember to have fun during the process. Your eyewear is a reflection of who you are, so excel in that uniqueness. After all, fashion begins where comfort meets individual flair. From functional to fashionable, with the multitude of eyewear options available today, finding the perfect pair of glasses to match your style and lifestyle has never been easier."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Workers worldwide wake up happy, then lose that good mood once their jobs begin, according to a two-year review of Twitter posts by 2.4 million people in 84 countries released today in the journal Science. While scientists have long known that work, sleep and sunshine can affect emotions, the study is among the first to mine social-media for real-time evidence of the connections, said researchers at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. The universe of people using social-networking sites such as those run by Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc. will almost double to 1.85 billion by 2015, according to research firm IDC, ushering in a new era of Internet-based study of human behavior. “Twitter almost records everything that happens in life,” said Scott Golder, the lead study author and a graduate student in sociology at Cornell, in an interview. “Mundane, inconsequential, and conversational tweets are a massive archive of digital traces.” San Francisco-based Twitter, with more than 100 million users worldwide, is a micro-blogging service that lets people post 140-character messages online. The updates are time- stamped, offering a rich trove of data, Golder said. Today’s study used text-analysis software to track mood fluctuations in the Twitter posts. Messages in the early morning and late evenings were most likely to contain happier words such as “awesome,” “super” and “fantastic,” Golder said. During the workday, missives tended to be peppered with negative language including “panic” and “fear.” U.S. workers spend an average of 62 minutes each day using social media for personal reasons, compared with 37 minutes for business purposes, according to a survey conducted in July by the Ponemon Institute. --Editors: Lisa Rapaport, Christian Nicholson To contact the reporter on this story: Xu Wang in New York at xwang206@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at ||||| It's not just you: That late-day slump is nearly universal, at least in the world of social network users. Sociologists at Cornell University studied updates from millions of Twitter users, analyzing tweets on an hourly and daily basis. After breakfast, moods from Dubuque to Dubai start going downhill. \\"We found a very similar pattern in India, Africa, Europe, the UK, Canada, North America, Australia, New Zealand. The patterns are very, very similar even though all those cultures are different,\\" said Michael Macy, a sociology professor at Cornell who, along with sociology graduate student Scott Golder, co-authored an article about the study in the latest issue of Science. NEWS: Parody Blooms on Twitter The sociologists analyzed more than half a million public updates from 2.4 million Twitter users in 84 countries over a two-year period. They divided the updates into groups by hour of the day and day of the week. Then they ran them through a program developed by psychologists to measure feelings. It uses a positive and a negative lexicon that each contain hundreds of words like \\"happy,\\" \\"excited,\\" \\"fearful\\" and \\"sad.\\" \\"People are most upbeat around breakfast time,\\" Macy said. \\"Their mood deteriorates over the course of the day and then rebounds in the evening. Around dinnertime on through the time they go to bed it picks back up again.\\" At first the sociologists wondered if this was due to work-related stress because overall moods tended to be elevated on weekends. But they noticed that even then, tweets expressed late-day mood dips, even in the United Arab Emirates where weekends are Fridays and Saturdays. \\"It could be that the elevated mood on the weekends is because they did not get woken up by an alarm clock, which would have disrupted their natural sleep patterns,\\" Macy notes. He cites strong evidence from previous research how important sleep is as a factor influencing feelings throughout the day. But how can searching for words in tweets tell the scientists how a person is feeling -- don't they need more context? Macy says it doesn't matter who or what someone is tweeting about. The psychological lexicons, which have been validated, determine general mood based on whether the words Twitter users choose to use are particularly positive or negative. \\"Social and behavioral scientists have these wonderful opportunities now to study human behavior and human interaction in ways they could not do before,\\" Macy said. Next, Macy says they are focused on using the enormous Twitter data to study behavior. Golder recently created a public website, Timeu.se , so anyone can do a keyword search on their data and plot the results. One of the sociologists' early findings: \\"happy hour\\" starts around 4 or 5 Monday through Thursday, but on Fridays begins after lunch and keeps going until 10 at night. NEWS: Can Tiny Tweets Predict Financial Markets? David Lazer is an associate professor of political science and computer science at Northeastern University. His group has determined countrywide moods based on Twitter updates, but the study didn't look at individuals' daily variations. \\"The new thing here is that they're clearly finding some sort of signal,\\" Lazer said of the Cornell article. \\"Part of what's beautiful about these data is that they truly offer a picture of the system as opposed to detached observations you might get in a standard survey.\\" When paired with traditional questionnaires, the Cornell results will give social scientists a better understanding of daily human rhythms, said Thomas Streeter, a sociology professor at the University of Vermont who studies media culture and technology. \\"Definitely there's a pattern there,\\" he said. \\"But of course they're talking about people who use Twitter. It's not farmers in Zimbabwe.\\" Social media can be ideal for expressing certain kinds of human expressions but not for others, he added. \\"We have to be careful to not read them as hot lines to our hearts.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A two-year review of Twitter posts by 2.4 million people across 84 countries, conducted by researchers at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, has provided insight into daily mood variations.

Despite - or perhaps because of - a third straight debate performance in which the retired neurosurgeon practically disappeared into the scenery thanks to his low-key public persona, he has continued to climb in the polls. The latest survey, by NBC News, puts him at 29% support, six points up on the former consensus leader, Donald Trump. Mr Carson also has the highest favourability ratings of any candidate, and he's the first or second pick of half the poll respondents - well ahead of all his competitors. By all accounts, then, Mr Carson is on the verge of assuming the mantle of Republican front-runner. While Florida Senator Marco Rubio was the talk of the Washington establishment after his most recent debate performance, the soft-spoken doctor continues to be a campaign juggernaut. But is Mr Carson's lead a mirage? Here are a few possible dark linings that could appear on Mr Carson's silver clouds. Mr Carson has compared gun control, political correctness, the US under Barack Obama and the progressive movement in general to Nazi rule. He's also drawn slavery analogies on the issues of healthcare reform and abortion and said prison sex is evidence that homosexuality is a choice and Muslims should be disqualified from the presidency It's Mr Carson's particular gift that he can deliver lines like these in the calm voice of physician informing his patient that the situation is dire but that a cure is possible, and then allow any resulting wave of controversy to wash over him harmlessly. Although Mr Carson is currently riding high, at some point the cumulative effect of line after inflammatory line could be too much for Republican voter concerned about his prospects in a general election. Or, perhaps, it could put a hard cap on the level of support Mr Carson is able to accrue, creating difficulties for him as the field eventually narrows. Mr Carson's differences with fellow front-runner Donald Trump are more than just ones of style. After earlier criticisms that he was running a campaign without substance, the New York billionaire has released a series of plans - on immigration, tax reform, gun control and veteran's affairs. Other candidates have likewise released their plans, in greater and lesser detail. As for Mr Carson? Not so much. His website features a grab-bag of proposals, lightly sketched, including a call for a constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget, the \\"defeat\\" of federal education bureaucracy, the continued operation of the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and healthcare reform based on tax-free personal health savings accounts. He's also called for a flat tax on income that would replace the current progressive tax rate structure and has suggested that the rate be set at 10%, although it could range up to 15% depending on revenue necessities. As a front-runner will Mr Carson be pressed to flush out more policy details? Mr Trump was. So far, however, the retired neurosurgeon has gotten a pass. That, however, might be changing. \\"I want more details and answers,\\" Doug Holtz-Eakin, president of the conservative American Action Forum, told the Street's Valerie Young. \\"We've seen what uncertainly does to the economy. So if he wants to genuinely have a good performance, he needs to lay it out so people know what to expect.\\" When third quarter fundraising totals were announced last month, Mr Carson made headlines with a 20m - which put him ahead of all Republicans and just behind Democrats Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. As the Atlantic's David Graham points out, however, those numbers conceal a less rosy reality. Although Mr Carson is posting big numbers, he's spending a lot to do so. Fifty-four cents of every dollar the neurosurgeon brings in is spent on fundraising - such as developing donor files, printing direct mail literature and paying postage. By contrast, Mr Sanders - who relies heavily on online donations - spends just 4 cents of every dollar on fundraising. Conservative columnist Erick Erickson, notes that Mr Carson spent 69% of the money he took in - his \\"burn rate\\", as it's called - and offers a grim prognosis. \\"Carson's actual expenditure list reads like a wealthy Republican getting played by consultants,\\" he writes. \\"I suspect there are some who see Carson as a cash cow.\\" While that could be great news for political operatives involved, it's not good for a candidate who wants to win elections. Although Mr Carson has shot to the top of several national polls, the Republican race for the presidential nomination is going to be decided on state-by-state battlegrounds, and his polls here so far have been less impressive. Mr Carson has led in several Iowa polls, but the latest puts him in effectively in a tie with Mr Trump. In New Hampshire - less fertile ground for an evangelical-backed conservative like Mr Carson - Mr Trump has posted numerous double-digit leads. The New Yorker has also dominated South Carolina and Florida surveys. None of this is to say that Mr Carson can't turn his national support into a lead in key early-voting states. The reality, however, is that Mr Trump still poses a formidable opponent with loyal supporters who have stuck with him for months now. Will Mr Carson consolidate his gains the same way? Time will tell. During the third Republican debate in Colorado last week, moderator Carlos Quintanilla questioned Mr Carson about his ties to the nutritional supplement company Mannatech, which has paid millions of dollars in fines for deceptive marketing practices. Mr Carson denied having \\"an involvement\\" with the company, saying only that he happily takes the product and was paid to give speeches for them. Quintanilla tried to press the issue but was booed by the debate audience, prompting Mr Carson to smile and conclude, \\"See, they know\\". The questions about Mannatech can't easily be written off as a liberal-media obsession, however. The Jim Geraghty of the conservative National Review has been one of the most dogged investigators into the ties between Mr Carson and the supplement company, and after the debate he said Mr Carson's answers were \\"bald-faced lies\\". \\"Mannatech wanted to improve its image and happily paid Carson, one of the country's greatest neurosurgeons, the man Cuba Gooding Jr played in the [TNT] movie - to appear at their events and to appear in the company videos,\\" he writes. \\"Carson's lack of due diligence before working with the company is forgivable. His blatant lying about it now is much harder to forgive.\\" Mr Carson has pushed back, telling SiriusXM's Breitbart News Daily radio show that the National Review has become a \\"political tool\\" of his one of his Republican opponents and that the story was a \\"submarine that's sent by them\\". Whether he's wrong or right about his allegations, chances are the Mannatech story isn't going away anytime soon. Some writers, on the left and on the right, have attempted to draw lines between the aforementioned concerns - the litany of publicity-generating controversial statements, the lack of policy details, the questionable fundraising practices, the ethical questions surrounding ties to Mannatech - to draw larger conclusions about the nature of Mr Carson's presidential quest. Leon Wolf, a diarist for the conservative RedState blog, wonders whether Mr Carson's apparent lack of command of the issues reflects poorly on his commitment to the campaign \\"I am distressed that he has spent apparently no time in study educating himself on the basic issues he would face during the course of the run for his presidency,\\" he writes. \\"I am 100% confident Carson could understand them very easily, which is precisely the reason I'm so bothered that he doesn't. It goes to the seriousness with which he takes the job of running for president, and his personal work ethic at that job.\\" He contrasts Mr Carson with former technology company executive Carly Fiorina, who has spent considerable time honing her command of the issues. \\"I'm at a loss as to what Ben Carson has been doing at all, and I'm disappointed that he apparently doesn't take running for president seriously,\\" he concludes. New York Magazine's Jonathan Chait concludes that Mr Carson says the obvious explanation for Mr Carson's actions is his goal isn't the presidency, it's the accumulation of wealth. \\"Carson is doing a lot of things that seem puzzling for a presidential campaign, but quite logical for a brand-building exercise,\\" he writes. \\"Perhaps it is a giveaway that the official title for Armstrong Williams, the figure running the Carson 'campaign', is 'business manager', as opposed to 'campaign manager'. It does suggest that Carson is engaged in a for-profit venture.\\" The nebulousness of Mr Carson's campaign so far leaves him open to these sorts of attacks. How Mr Carson responds - with substance or bluster - will go a long way in revealing whether his candidacy can make it to the finish line. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"Retired neurosurgeon, Ben Carson, is on the verge of assuming the mantle of Republican front-runner, with the latest NBC News' survey putting him at 29% support, six points up on Donald Trump. However, his lead may be a mirage. Mr Carson's inflammatory lines may eventually deter Republican voters who are concerned about his prospects in a general election. Unlike Donald Trump, Mr Carson has not set out solid plans on areas such as immigration, and tax reform, but instead suggests lightly sketched proposals. Additionally, although Mr Carson has substantial contributions, he spends a significant amount on fundraising compared to other candidates. In state-by-state battlegrounds, Mr Trump currently poses a formidable opponent, leading Carson in polls for the early-voting states of New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Florida. Questions surrounding Mr Carson's ties to nutritional supplement company Mannatech and his campaign's nature are additional concerns that might challenge his chances in the Republican race."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.\\"?

Blunt-spoken and popular with military personnel, Kelly, 66, was born and raised in Boston. He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976. Kelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. He succeeded General Douglas Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) on Nov. 19, 2012. As the head of USSOUTHCOM, Kelly was in charge of the military jail at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also was exposed to immigration, drug trafficking and other cross-border problems over a sprawling area that encompasses 32 countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America. Kelly took a tough tone on border security, warning Congress last year about the risks of smuggling rings in Mexico and Central America that spirited \\"tens of thousands of people,\\" including unaccompanied children, \\"to our nation's doorstep.\\" He also clashed with the Obama administration over plans to close Guantanamo and the Pentagon's order that opened all jobs in combat units to women, including the most elite forces like the Navy SEALs.

Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Memory is essential for life. We have a short-term memory and a long-term memory. When we get old, our short-term memory becomes weaker, but we can still remember things that happened a long time ago. There are many things we can do to improve our memory, such as using various memorizing methods as well as taking special care of our health. It is important that we regularly stimulate our brain to make our memory more efficient . For example, we can do activities that we do not usually do and change our daily habits. Learning a new skill helps our brain develop. When trying to memorize something, we should focus our attention on the most important things about it. Do not allow other thoughts to enter our mind because this will lower our chances of remembering things correctly. One basic way of improving our memory is to use the link method. If we want to memorize something, we should make a picture in our mind. If the picture is silly, strange and colourful, we will remember it better. Taking notes, being organized and keeping a diary will also be useful tools. Sometimes, memory is connected with our feelings. When something dramatic happens, we usually remember it well, and we also remember where we were and what we were doing. Healthy food and plenty of vitamins are important to our memory. Drinking a lot of water also helps maintain our memory. When we are asleep, our brain stores memory. Not enough sleep can, therefore, cause problems with storing information. In addition, being tired will stop us from being able to remember well. As a result, keeping fit and having regular health checks are both important as well. Question: When people try to remember the word 'smiles', an easy way to do this is to imagine there is a 'mile' between the first letter and the last letter.

Question: Question: where did the money for the new scoreboard in milwaukee come from I found the following answer on Google: The team is so named because of the city's association with the brewing industry. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the answer you found on Google is not a correct answer to the question about the funding for the new scoreboard in Milwaukee. The information you found refers to the origin of the name of Milwaukee's Major League Baseball team, the Milwaukee Brewers, which is indeed named due to the city's association with the brewing industry. However, this information does not address the issue of funding for a new scoreboard. To answer the original question, we would need to investigate the specific details surrounding the financing of the new scoreboard. Ideally, you would need to provide more context, such as the name of the specific sports facility or the year the new scoreboard was installed to provide a detailed and accurate answer. In general, financing for scoreboards and other facility upgrades could come from various sources such as: 1. Public funding: This could include funds allocated by the city, county, or state government for facility improvements or infrastructure projects. These funds may be raised through taxes or government bonds. 2. Private financing: Team owners, stadium operators, or private entities may contribute money to fund facility upgrades. Private financing is often provided through loans, personal investments, or in some cases, donations. 3. Sponsorship and advertising deals: Companies and organizations can pay for the naming rights or advertising space on a scoreboard as part of a sponsorship deal. Such deals can be a significant source of revenue and may partially or fully cover the costs of a new scoreboard. 4. Grants: Some organizations or foundations might provide grants for facility improvements or sports-related projects. These grants typically require a detailed application and proposal process, and the recipients may need to demonstrate how the improvements will benefit the sports community or local area. In the case of Milwaukee, it is essential to research the specific details about the new scoreboard to determine the exact funding sources. But it is essential to remember that the city's connection to the brewing industry does not directly relate to the funding of a new scoreboard."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Question: What century does the film take place in?

Given the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\", is \\"call the police\\" a valid answer? Pick from: - Yes; - No;","completion":"Yes, \\"call the police\\" is indeed a valid answer when considering the context of the situation. If others have been informed of a secret concerning a murder that happened last night, it would be a reasonable, responsible, and legal action to contact law enforcement. When someone learns information about a major crime such as murder, the immediate course of action should ideally be to inform the police. It's important to remember that withholding such information could potentially obstruct justice or even put oneself or others in danger. In such cases, every bit of information can be significant and contribute to the successful resolution of the case. As such, the secret that Cameron shared can potentially provide crucial data to the investigation, leading to the capture and conviction of the perpetrators, hence putting an end to any more potential harm that could be caused. In this regard, it's helpful to understand that the person who received this secret from Cameron has been put in a situation of witnessing potentially damning information. This individual has then become a bystander to serious criminal activity. At this point, they have a moral and societal obligation to share this information with the appropriate authorities. However, it's also worth considering the personal safety of this individual. If the information they have is extremely sensitive or exposes them directly to the killers or people related to the crime, contacting law enforcement should still be their next step, but they should also take precautionary measures to ensure their safety. They may seek additional guidance from authorities on this aspect. Therefore, considering all these factors, \\"call the police\\" perfectly reflects what others would want to do next after finding out a secret about a murder. This response is not only valid and expected, but it also serves the common societal good of reporting a crime and contributing to justice being served."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the following context: EMI reissued OK Computer again on 24 March 2009, alongside Pablo Honey and The Bends, without Radiohead's involvement. The reissue came in two editions: a 2-CD \\"Collector's Edition\\" and a 2-CD 1-DVD \\"Special Collector's Edition\\". The first disc contains the original studio album, the second disc contains B-sides collected from OK Computer singles and live recording sessions, and the DVD contains a collection of music videos and a live television performance. All the material on the reissue had been previously released. Press reaction to the reissue expressed concern that EMI was exploiting Radiohead's back catalogue. Larry Fitzmaurice of Spin accused EMI of planning to \\"issue and reissue [Radiohead's] discography until the cash stops rolling in\\". Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal said it was \\"hard to look at these reissues as anything other than a cash-grab for EMI/Capitol—an old media company that got dumped by their most forward-thinking band.\\" Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone defended the release, saying: \\"While it's easy to accuse Capitol of milking the cash cow once again, these sets are pretty comprehensive.\\"The reissue was critically well received, although reception was mixed about the supplemental material. Reviews in AllMusic, Uncut, Q, Rolling Stone, Paste and PopMatters praised the supplemental material, but with reservations.

Given the following passage \\"After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy. Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls. He was quickly hailed as king of Macedon and went on to rule for 35 years.\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text. Question: The people who beat Demetrius were from Epirus and where? Answer:","completion":"The people who beat Demetrius were from Epirus and Thrace. To arrive at this answer, I first identified the relevant event in the passage where Demetrius was defeated - \\"He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts...\\" Here, the passage indicates that Lysimachus from Thrace and Pyrrhus from Epirus were the ones who defeated Demetrius.

Is \\"The value of the U.S. dollar declined significantly during wartime, especially during the American Civil War, World War I, and World War II.\\" a good answer to the question \\"During which times does the value of the dollar typically decline?\\"","completion":"The statement you provided, \\"The value of the U.S. dollar declined significantly during wartime, especially during the American Civil War, World War I, and World War II,\\" offers historical context for the original question, \\"During which time does the value of the dollar typically decline?\\" However, the answer can be further expanded and explained to give a more thorough response. The following detailed answer addresses the factors contributing to currency fluctuation and the reasons behind the decline during these war periods while exploring other factors that contribute to the downfall of a currency. The value of a country's currency like the U.S. dollar is influenced by several factors, such as economic growth, interest rates, geopolitical risks, inflation rates, and capital flows. But one notable factor that can drastically affect the value of a national currency is wartime or during significant political unrest and uncertainties. The provided statement highlights that the value of the U.S. dollar has typically declined during wartime, such as the American Civil War, World War I, and World War II. To better respond to the question, it's essential to understand why the value of the dollar declines during these periods and discuss other factors that could lead to a depreciation of a currency. During major conflicts like the American Civil War, World War I, and World War II, the United States increased its military expenditures to fund and support its armed forces. To finance these expenses, the government often increases taxes, issues public debt, or prints more money. As money is freshly minted, the sudden increase in the money supply stimulates inflation, causing the purchasing power of the currency to decline and subsequently reducing its value. Furthermore, geopolitical risks and uncertainties degrade investor confidence, causing them to scale back their investments or seek alternative assets, thus impacting the dollar's value in foreign exchange markets. In addition to wartime, other factors contribute to a weakening currency. High inflation rates can drive down the value of a currency since it erodes the purchasing power over time, causing investors to lose confidence in holding the currency. Lower interest rates can lead to a decline in the demand for a national currency, as foreign investors seek better returns in countries with higher interest rates. Economic downturns in the issuing country or a stronger economy in another nation may cause market participants to move their funds out of the weaker currency and into a stronger one, pushing the value down. Moreover, unanticipated events, such as natural disasters or political shifts, negatively impact a nation's economic conditions, ultimately lowering the value of its currency. In summary, the statement provided accurately highlights that the value of the U.S. dollar typically declines during wartime, as seen during the American Civil War, World War I, and World War II. However, it is essential to elaborate on the factors driving the decline in dollar value during these wars, as well as on other elements contributing to currency depreciation. An adequate answer to the question should encompass these multiple factors, sharing insights into the relationship between inflation, interest rates, economic growth, political uncertainty, and overall market conditions that can lead to currency fluctuation. This broader knowledge will help develop a more comprehensive understanding of what conditions typically cause dollar value decline and result in a more detailed and informative answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In so many ways, this is quite fitting, as when it was made back in 1933, it was truly a cheaply made film by the \\"poverty row\\" studio, Majestic. However, while the film is rather derivative, it is STILL well worth watching and provides a few surprises. The story is very, very familiar, as in some Germanic town, the people are upset because of some recent deaths that appear to be the work of vampires! Adding to this familiarity is Dwight Frye. He played Renfield in Dracula, and here he is very, very similar--though he plays a much more harmless weirdo. In this case, he's obsessed with his pet bats and people begin to blame him for the deaths. The film does a good job of providing some \\"red herrings\\" (i.e., false leads) and while it doesn't take a genius to figure out Frye may not be responsible, the WHO and WHY are intriguing and make it VERY different from the average horror film. In addition, while the production had little money to speak of, it still had some good actors of the day--Lionel Atwill and Melvin Douglas--and it also used Universal Studios sets at night (when they were done filming for the day). As a result, the film looks pretty good overall, though I also thought that, as usual, Fay Wray was terrible--thought it didn't noticeably detract from the film. I have seen her in more movies than most people on IMDb and I have come to notice that her characters have no depth--she always seems to be cast as the \\"screaming lady\\" and provides little new in each film.

Questions: Where would you enjoy a beer while throwing heavy spheres toward ten white objects? Options: - bowling alley - hockey game - sporting event - croquet - fridge A:","completion":"A bowling alley would be the most appropriate option for enjoying a beer while throwing heavy spheres toward ten white objects. This setting is most in line with common sense as the scenario described fits the general environment and activity that one would expect at a bowling alley. Firstly, the \\"heavy spheres\\" mentioned in the question are most likely referring to bowling balls which are typically used as the primary equipment in a game of bowling. Bowling balls are designed to be heavy enough to knock down the ten white objects, in this case, the bowling pins. These pins are usually white or have a combination of white and bright colors to make them easily distinguishable from the lanes and background. Next, the act of enjoying a beer is a common occurrence in many social and leisure activities, especially in venues that cater to entertainment and relaxation. Drinking beer is also quite common in bowling alleys, where it can be purchased from the in-house bar or restaurant. These establishments often serve a variety of beverages, including alcoholic drinks like beer, to cater to the diverse tastes and preferences of their patrons. Furthermore, bowling alleys provide the necessary infrastructure and equipment, such as bowling lanes, balls, pins, and automated pinsetters, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience for those who want to partake in this recreational activity. Additionally, many bowling alleys combine other forms of entertainment such as arcades, pool tables, or sports viewing areas, which can contribute to a engaging and enjoyable atmosphere. In contrast, the other options presented (a hockey game, sporting event, croquet, or fridge) do not align as closely with the given scenario: - A hockey game and sporting events in general do not involve participants throwing heavy spheres toward ten white objects. While people may enjoy a beer while watching the event, these scenarios don't create the optimal environment for this specific activity. - Croquet is a sport played with wooden mallets to hit balls through hoops, and it does not involve throwing heavy spheres or knocking down ten white objects. Likewise, it is typically an outdoor game played in more intimate settings like gardens, parks, or homes and not a common place for consuming beer while playing. - A fridge is an appliance designed to store and preserve food and beverages, so it is not an appropriate venue for any form of recreational activity nor a place to enjoy a beer. In conclusion, a bowling alley is the most suitable location to enjoy a beer while throwing heavy spheres toward ten white objects, based on common sense and the nature of the activity and environment described in the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Meanwhile, the boys' father, Sam Douglas, is an FBI agent who stages a sting operation to entrap Hugo Snyder in the sale of warheads. Snyder escapes the trap with the use of his own ninja henchmen. Snyder decides to test Mori's fighting skill. The boys ignore Mori's orders to stay in the house and aid by defeating two ninjas on their own. Snyder threatens Mori's family if he doesn't get Douglas off his back, and Mori chides the boys briefly for interfering in his personal affairs. When they return home, they find their father unenthusiastic to see what they had learned during their visit and more annoyed at their new names. Emily, a friend of Rocky's, compliments his new name and agrees to ride with them to school the next day. Snyder develops a plan to kidnap the boys to use them as leverage to get Douglas to back off.

The stone house served as their lodge and as a tavern; it was known as \\"Ricketts Folly\\" for its isolated location in the wilderness. Clemuel died in 1858 and Elijah bought his share of the land and house. The Ricketts family was not aware of the glens and their waterfalls until about 1865, when they were discovered by two guests from the stone house who went fishing and wandered down Kitchen Creek.Elijah's son Robert Bruce Ricketts, for whom the park is named, joined the Union Army as a private at the outbreak of the American Civil War and rose through the ranks to become a colonel in the artillery. After the war, R. Bruce Ricketts returned to Pennsylvania and in 1869 began purchasing the land around the lake from his father. By 1873 he controlled or owned 66,000 acres (27,000 ha), and eventually this grew to more than 80,000 acres (32,000 ha), including the glens and waterfalls and most of the park.While the stone house had served as a home and inn since its construction, in 1872 R.

Q:Given the following passage \\"The pro-decolonisation Labour government, elected at the 1945 general election and led by Clement Attlee, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: that of Indian independence. India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives.

Paragraph: Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage. That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage. \\"Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies,\\" said Noel D. Matchett, a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc., Silver Spring, Md.

The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association, a joint industry-government trade group. Any secret can be pirated, the experts said, if it is transmitted over the air. Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder. They need only position themselves near a company's satellite dish and wait. \\"You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time,\\" Mr. Matchett said, adding : \\"It's a pretty good bet they won't get caught.\\" The only way to catch an electronic thief, he said, is to set him up with erroneous information.

Summarize this article: In a 289-137 vote, the House on Thursday easily approved legislation that requires new screening requirements on refugees from Syria and Iraq before they can enter the United States. ADVERTISEMENT Forty-seven Democrats defied President Obama’s veto threat and backed the bill — enough to override a presidential veto given the six Democrats and two Republicans who missed the vote. The 47 Democrats who voted for the bill ranged from centrist Blue Dogs, vulnerable lawmakers in tough reelection races and even one member of leadership: Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.), who heads House Democrats' communications efforts. Two Republicans voted against the bill: Reps. Walter Jones (N.C.) and Steve King (Iowa). The outcome suggests the House could override Obama if he vetoes the measure, although there's no guarantee that Democrats will side against the president if they are asked to sustain a veto. The big question is whether the House will get a chance at an override vote. The legislation will now go to the Senate, where it may face a tougher path to passage. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid (Nev.) vowed to block the House bill if it is considered by the upper chamber after the Thanksgiving recess. “The problem is not with refugees,” Reid said. “I don’t think we’ll be dealing with it over here.” When asked about the prospect of Obama vetoing the legislation, Reid said, “Don’t worry, it won’t get passed. Next question?” Democrats in the upper chamber have been divided over the issue, and both parties have their eyes on winning a Senate majority in next year’s elections. The House vote comes less than a week after at least 129 people were killed in the Paris terrorist attacks. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has claimed responsibility for the carnage, and is also a big factor in the wave of refugees from Iraq and Syria flowing into Europe. Fears that terrorists could enter the United States through the refugee program sparked the House bill, which moved quickly through the chamber. Obama has planned to allow 10,000 Syrian refugees to enter the United States. Reports that one of the Paris attackers entered Europe by posing as a Syrian refugee has further fanned the flames. The legislation would prevent any refugees from Syria or Iraq from entering the United States until the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and Director of National Intelligence certify that none of them are dangerous. “If our law enforcement and our intelligence community cannot verify that each and every person is not a security threat, then they shouldn't be allowed in,” said Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanLawmakers shrug off shutdown drama Shutdown to drag on for days after Senate adjourns without deal Both sides play blame game on first day of shutdown MORE (R-Wis.). “We cannot and we should not wait to act. Not when our national security is at stake,” he added. Obama has engaged in an at times personal war of words with Republicans over the legislation, even as he continues a foreign trip. He argued that keeping out Syrian refugees fleeing terrorism and war in their country was an affront to American values. In a statement outlining its veto threat, the Obama administration argued the bill would “provide no meaningful additional security for the American people” and impose new certification requirements that effectively end the refugee program. “The United States has always been and should always be a place of refuge,” said Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). “We might as well take down the Statue of Liberty.” Yet top administration officials, just hours before the vote, struggled to convince undecided House Democrats to oppose the bill. The Obama administration has said the vetting process typically already takes more than a year for each refugee. But FBI Director James Comey acknowledged in a hearing last month that certain gaps remain in the administration’s ability to fully vet each refugee applicant. If the bill is blocked in the Senate, House Republicans are already looking toward a catchall government spending bill, known as an omnibus, as their best leverage to force the Obama administration’s hand. Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.), a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said he would vote against a spending bill that doesn’t contain provisions halting the refugee program. “I think that we have to exert maximum leverage,” Salmon told The Hill. Those threats raise the possibility of a showdown over the issue that could lead to a government shutdown. Congress must pass legislation by Dec. 11 to keep the government open.

Dozens of Democrats joined Republicans as the House passed the measure 289-137. That margin exceeded the two-thirds majority required to override a veto, and it came despite a rushed, early morning visit to the Capitol by top administration officials in a futile attempt to limit Democratic defections for the measure. Thursday's vote came six days after a burst of bombings and shootings in Paris killed 129 people, wounded many more and revived post-9/11 jitters in the U.S. and Europe. The attacks have turned the question of admitting people fleeing war-torn Syria and Iraq into a high-stakes political issue in both the United States and Europe, and many congressional Democrats were willing to vote against their party's lame duck president for fear of angering voters nervous about security at home. Democrats opposing the GOP bill said the U.S. has no business abandoning its age-old values, including being a safe haven for people fleeing countries racked by violence. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks and controls vast swathes of Syria and Iraq, despite a growing military campaign against them by the U.S. and other nations. \\"Defeating terrorism should not mean slamming the door in the faces of those fleeing the terrorists. We might as well take down the Statue of Liberty,\\" said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. Republicans said that in dangerous times, the government must first protect its own. \\"It is against the values of our nation and the values of a free society to give terrorists the opening they are looking for\\" by not tightening entry restrictions, said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. Before Thursday's House vote, the White House sent chief of staff Denis McDonough and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to the Capitol to try winning over Democrats. Democratic aides said Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., had a forceful exchange with Johnson, saying that opposition to the bill would be a terrible vote for Democrats that could cost them seats in next year's elections. With the House's 246 Republicans ready to solidly support the legislation, the administration was eager to keep the final tally for the bill below the two-thirds margin required to override a veto. In a sign of the conflicting political undercurrents confronting Democrats, senior House Democrats said they did not push rank-and-file lawmakers to oppose the bill. \\"I've said to them from the start, 'Nobody's asked you to do anything. Do whatever works for you, for your district,'\\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who opposed the legislation, told journalists. Freshman Rep. Brad Ashford, D-Neb., who faces a tough re-election fight next year, called the Paris attacks \\"a game changer\\" and supported the bill, saying, \\"I cannot sit back and ignore the concerns of my constituents and the American public.\\" The measure, which in effect would suspend admissions of Syrian and Iraqi refugees, would require the FBI to conduct background checks on people coming to the U.S. from those countries. It would oblige the heads of the FBI and Homeland Security Department and the director of national intelligence to certify to Congress that each refugee \\"is not a threat to the security of the United States.\\" On the campaign trail, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton said the U.S. should welcome refugees from the region and bolster America's defenses and intelligence operations. On the Senate floor, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who hasn't yet scheduled debate on the issue, said Thursday it is time \\"to press pause\\" so policy makers could decide whether adequate vetting procedures are in place, calling it \\"the most responsible thing for the administration to do right now.\\" Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said he's been disgusted in recent days by the comments from Republicans and called it \\"fear-mongering and bigotry.\\" In a statement assuring a veto, the White House said the GOP bill would not improve Americans' security. It said the legislation \\"would unacceptably hamper our efforts to assist some of the most vulnerable people in the world, many of whom are victims of terrorism, and would undermine our partners in the Middle East and Europe in addressing the Syrian refugee crisis.\\" Currently, the refugee screening process typically takes 18 to 24 months and includes interviews, fingerprinting and database crosschecks by several federal agencies. Syrians undergo additional screening involving data from the U.N. Refugee Agency and interviews by Homeland Security Department officials trained to question Syrians. The Obama administration wants to increase the 70,000 refugees to be admitted from around the world this year by 10,000, with much of the increase for Syrians. The White House said that of 2,174 Syrians admitted to the U.S. since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, none has been arrested or deported because of allegations they harbored extremist ambitions. ___ AP Congressional Correspondent Erica Werner and writers Andrew Taylor and Matthew Daly contributed to this report. ||||| AP Photo House approves Syrian refugees bill The bill sees near unanimous support from Republicans and broad support from Democrats. The House passed a bill Thursday that would block Syrian and Iraqi refugees from entering the country unless they pass strict background checks — setting up a collision with President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats. The bill had near unanimous support from Republicans, who were joined by 47 Democrats — even after the Obama administration made a last-minute pitch to persuade wavering House Democrats to oppose the GOP-written bill. And with 289 \\"yes\\" votes, Republicans also won a veto-proof majority for the measure. Story Continued Below The bipartisan support was a rebuke of President Barack Obama by House Democrats who felt that the administration failed to make a compelling case as to why they should vote against the Republican-authored bill when it was bad politics to do so. “I think a lot of us went in with open minds and really wanted to understand the administration’s position on this,” said New York Democrat Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney. “It is offensive to me that we would stigmatize refugees…but if you read the bill what you find is that you have a pretty simple certification process sitting on top of an existing and extensive screening process that most of us believe works pretty well.” Maloney voted for the bill. The vote was a significant loss for the White House — perhaps the biggest setback since most of the House Democratic Caucus voted against Obama on a trade bill in mid-June. Thursday’s vote, coupled with the Iranian nuclear agreement bill from September, also shows that Republicans plan to make national security a key issue in the 2016 elections. The measure faces an uncertain future in the Senate. Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) pledged Thursday that the Syria bill won’t make it to Obama’s desk. Senators will likely attempt to tack the measure as a rider to the government spending bill that Congress has to address in December. “We’ve explained here in some detail [that] the problem is not with refugees. I haven’t read the House language,” Reid said during a press conference on Thursday. “I don’t think we’re going to be dealing with it over here.” Already conservative House Republicans are signaling they won’t vote to support December’s so-called omnibus bill unless it includes beefed-up provisions for vetting Syrian refugees while Democrats in the House are calling for a budget bill free of all contentious policy riders. The final 289- 137 vote was expected as House Democrats began signaling early Thursday there was not broad support in their caucus to take a tough vote on national security. In response, the White House dispatched chief of staff Denis McDonough and Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson to Capitol Hill to speak with Democrats just hours before the House vote. It was clear, lawmakers said, that the White House is trying to keep the number of Democratic defections low. But Multiple sources said McDonough and Johnson's \\"in the weeds\\" presentation didn't receive wide support in the room. The administration officials tried to make the case that the current vetting system was enough and that the Department of Homeland Security found the process too burdensome under the Republican-authored bill. That message fell hard with Democrats. Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.), who voted for the bill, said he not swayed by Johnson’s pitch to Democrats that the Homeland Security Department doesn’t have time to certify refugees. “If you look at the bill, it’s hard to see how it’s as awful as the administration is portraying it as,” Peters said. Sources said Maloney pushed back against the White House, saying the issue is \\"toxic\\" — even if Democrats oppose the Republican bill on policy grounds — because of the complicated messaging surrounding the national security issue. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas also questioned whether the opposition from the White House was wise for rank-and-file members of the caucus. Rep. Gerry Connolly said White House officials didn't make an effective pitch during the meeting with Democrats. He urged them to drop their opposition to the Republican bill. \\"It's one more assurance that those coming into the country are screened,\\" the Virginia Democrat said of the GOP-sponsored measure. \\"That seems to me not an imprudent measure under the circumstances.\\" House Democratic leaders urged their colleagues to oppose the legislation but did not formally whip colleagues. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) made an informal whip count Wednesday night to gauge where the caucus is. \\"Nobody is asking you to do anything but listen,\\" Pelosi told lawmakers during the closed-door meeting Wednesday, according to sources in the room. Before the vote, Pelosi, who voted against the GOP bill, said the current process is sufficiently thorough. “The process that is currently in place is thorough and robust and long as it is fully implemented and not diluted…it will allow us to safely admit the most vulnerable refugees while protecting the American people,” the California Democrat said on the floor. Pelosi did push for Democrats to support a procedural move known as a motion to recommit. That move — essentially a Democratic alternative — would require the Department of Homeland Security only to certify that refugees have passed requirement standards. It was drafted by Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, the ranking member on the Homeland Security Committee, and California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on a Judiciary subcommittee tasked with immigration. The Republican legislation, the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, would require the FBI, Homeland Security Department and director of national intelligence to certify to Congress that any refugee from Syria or Iraq is \\"not a threat to the security of the United States\\" before being allowed to settle in the United States. President Barack Obama has proposed allowing 10,000 Syrian refugees to enter the country this year, part of the Western response to the wave of millions of refugees fleeing that country's bloody civil war and Islamic State-related violence. The White House has threatened to veto the measure. ||||| Summary:","completion":"On Thursday the US House of Representatives voted 289-137 in favour of legislation that would suspend the Obama Administration's plan to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next year, increasing the chances that the plan will be blocked in the Senate. The decision comes despite President Obama threatening that he would veto the legislation if it reached the White House. The legislation, which passed with near unanimous support from Republicans and broad support from Democrats despite a last-minute visit from top administration officials, sets strict security requirements for Syrian and Iraqi refugees and only allows entry into the US after the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and Director of National Intelligence have certified that the refugees pose no danger to the US public. The new legislation must now win the approval of the US Senate before it is presented to the President for his signature; Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid, vowed to block the Senate vote after Thanksgiving recess."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: If you're here out of season, the costumes, worn year after year, will be on display in the 18th-century Casal de San Jordi. Hypothesis: The costumes are not on display at the Casal de San Jordi. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The premise provides a conditional statement about when the costumes are on display at the Casal de San Jordi, specifically mentioning that they are on display during \\"off-season\\" at the 18th-century location. The premise does not make any claims about the state of the costumes outside of this condition. Now let us examine the hypothesis which states that \\"The costumes are not on display at the Casal de San Jordi.\\" This hypothesis is not directly addressed by the premise and does not necessarily follow from it. The hypothesis claims a situation where the costumes are not on display; however, the premise only discusses when the costumes are indeed on display, which is during the off-season. To determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we should consider if there are any situations where the premise is true and the hypothesis is false. According to the premise, if it is off-season, then the costumes will be on display in the 18th-century Casal de San Jordi. Therefore, during off-season, the hypothesis claiming that the costumes are not on display is false, which confirms that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. In summary, the hypothesis that \\"The costumes are not on display at the Casal de San Jordi\\" is not entailed by the premise that \\"If you're here out of season, the costumes, worn year after year, will be on display in the 18th-century Casal de San Jordi.\\" The premise explicitly discusses when the costumes are on display, while the hypothesis posits a situation where they are not. As the premise does not provide enough information to fully support the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Gallagher was born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal in 1948. His father Daniel was employed by the Irish Electricity Supply Board, who were constructing Cathaleen's Fall hydroelectric power station on the Erne River above the town. The family moved, first to Derry City, where his younger brother Donal was born in 1949. His mother, Monica, and the two boys then moved to Cork, where the brothers were raised. Gallagher played a worn sunburst 1961 Stratocaster (Serial Number 64351) for some years. It was reputedly the first in Ireland,and was ordered from Fender by Jim Connolly, a member of The Irish Showband. In 1961, Connolly ordered a cherry red Stratocaster through Crowley's music shop of Cork's McCurtain Street. When Fender shipped a sunburst Stratocaster instead, it was put up on sale in 1963 as a second-hand instrument, which Gallagher bought in August 1963 for just under PS100. Speaking about Gallagher's purchase, his brother Donal recalled: \\"His dream ambition was to have a guitar like Buddy Holly... This Stratocaster was in the store as a used instrument, it was 100 pounds... in today's money you couldn't even compare you might as well say it was a million pounds... my mother was saying we'll be in debt for the rest of our lives and Rory said well actually with a guitar like this I can play both parts, rhythm and lead, we won't need a rhythm player so I can earn more money and pay it off so the Stratocaster became his partner for life if you like.\\" The guitar was extensively modified by Gallagher. The tuning pegs and the nut were replaced, the latter interchanged a number of times. The pickguard was also changed during Gallagher's time with Taste. Only the middle pick-up is original. The final modification was the wiring: Gallagher disconnected the bottom tone pot and rewired it so he had just a master tone control along with the master volume control. He installed a 5-way selector switch in place of the vintage 3-way one. Most of the paint was removed from the guitar in 1967 or 1968 during the Taste period, as evidenced from contemporary photographs. Although the Strat was left abandoned in a rainy ditch for days after being stolen from the back of a tour van in Dublin, this is not believed to have caused any ill effect. A borrowed Telecaster was also stolen at the same time but never recovered. When the Strat was recovered two weeks later, Gallagher swore he would never sell it or paint it. The paint removal and appearance of extensive road wear was in keeping with Gallaghers public persona and image. It also had a period of time of having a replacement neck, with the original neck bowing due to the amount of moisture it absorbed during continuous touring. The neck was taken off and left to settle, and was eventually reunited with the Strat after returning to its correct shape. Other quirks include a 'hump' in the scratch plate which moves the neck pick-up closer to the neck on the bass side, and a replacement of all of the pick-ups, though this replacement was due to damage rather than the perception of a tonal inadequacy. One final point of interest is that one of the clay double-dot inlays at the 12th fret fell out and was replaced with a plastic one, which is why it is whiter than the other clay inlays. On 21 and 22 October 2011, Rory's brother Donal brought the guitar out of retirement to allow Joe Bonamassa to perform with it on his two nights at the London Hammersmith Apollo. Bonamassa opened both night's performances with his rendition of \\"Cradle Rock\\" using Gallagher's Stratocaster.

England had Australia 60-4 but the hosts recovered to post 278-8. Johnson swept through England's top order and Maxwell's off-spinners did the rest as England were 166 all out. England have now lost 13 of their last 15 one-day internationals against Australia in Australia and have only two warm-up games before they face them again in their World Cup opener on 14 February. Captain Eoin Morgan still has several puzzles to solve, not least his own patchy form with the bat - the left-hander made 121 in the tri-series opener in Sydney but has posted scores of 0, 2 and 0 since. The hosts were 0-1 after James Anderson dismissed Aaron Finch with the third ball of the innings and David Warner followed in the seventh over, deflecting a lifting ball from Anderson to point. Stuart Broad did for George Bailey, the under-pressure Tasmanian fending a short ball to short-leg to leave Australia tottering on 46-3. In-form Steve Smith batted confidently for his 40 but was stumped by Jos Buttler at the second attempt after coming down the pitch to Moeen Ali. But Maxwell and Mitchell Marsh put on 141 for the fifth wicket, the former demonstrating his full array of strokes and bringing up his ninth one-day international fifty with a reverse pull for four. Maxwell hit four boundaries in one Chris Woakes over before falling to Broad in the next, while Marsh was run out for 60 soon after. James Faulkner hit four sixes - including three in one Woakes over - to race to an unbeaten, 24-ball fifty and transform what would have been a below-par total into a testing target. Anderson was again the pick of England's bowlers with 2-38 while Woakes's bowling figures of 0-89 from 10 overs were the fourth worst for England in ODI history. England's openers made a confident start before Ian Bell nicked a fine delivery from Josh Hazlewood and wicketkeeper Brad Haddin snaffled a brilliant one-handed catch. Enter Johnson, who took 37 wickets in Australia's Ashes whitewash of England last winter but had played no international cricket in 2015. James Taylor never looked settled before skewing Johnson to gully, where Maxwell took an excellent catch diving low to his left. And when Moeen fended a wicked Johnson bouncer to second slip and Morgan shouldered arms to a straight delivery next ball, England were in disarray on 46-4. Faulkner picked up his 50th ODI wicket when he had Joe Root lbw with his first delivery, but the Tasmanian all-rounder was forced to leave the field soon after with a side injury. Buttler looked in fine form before reverse-sweeping off-spinner Maxwell to substitute fielder Pat Cummings and Woakes was gone next ball, offering up a simple caught and bowled. Broad played some big shots before holing out to deep mid-wicket, Ravi Bopara became Maxwell's fourth victim when he holed out to extra-cover and Hazlewood bowled Steve Finn to wrap up the win. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"In this one-day international match, Australia staged a remarkable comeback to defeat England by 112 runs, with Glenn Maxwell being the star of the game with 95 runs and 4-46 as a bowler. The Australian team managed to recover from a difficult 60-4 start to post a score of 278-8. Mitchell Johnson's return to international cricket brought a 3-27 bowling performance, which significantly impacted England's top order. As England failed to chase down the target, they were all out at 166. This loss adds to England's poor record against Australia in Australia, with only two warm-up games remaining before they face each other again in the World Cup opener on February 14. England's captain, Eoin Morgan, has to address his own inconsistent form with the bat, as well as strategize improvements for the team.

They are typically worn by female dancers, they are called flamenco heel, often with traje de flamenca costumes. Male flamenco dancers traditionally wear short, heeled boots, although there are now some flamenco shoe styles available for men. Can we infer the following? Flamenco dancers, both male and female, wear the same shoes.","completion":"We cannot infer that flamenco dancers, both male and female, wear the same shoes based on the given information. In fact, it is evident that there are differences in the footwear worn by male and female flamenco dancers. Here is a detailed explanation: Flamenco is a traditional Spanish dance with its roots in Andalusia, Spain. It is characterized by its emotive movements, intricate footwork, and unique musical accompaniments. The performance typically consists of three parts: cante (singing), baile (dancing), and toque (guitar playing). Flamenco shoes for female dancers, often referred to as flamenco heels, are characterized by their distinct design. They usually have a low or medium heel that is thick and sturdy, providing support and stability for the dancer during their performance. The closed-toe shoe is fashioned from materials such as leather or suede and often has a strap running across the instep to help keep the shoe in place during the quick footwork and intense movements that are typical of flamenco dancing. The soles of these shoes are typically made of hard materials, which help to produce the clear and distinctive sound of foot stomping, known as \\"taconeo,\\" on the wooden dance floor. In addition, traditional female flamenco shoes may feature decorative designs, such as stitching, tassels, or subtle embellishments, which can complement the colors and patterns of the traje de flamenca, the flamenco dress worn by female dancers. These dresses, known for their ruffles and bold colors, are an integral part of the flamenco costume and performance. On the other hand, male flamenco dancers often wear short, heeled boots that are specifically designed for their performance requirements. These boots are usually made from materials such as leather or suede and have a low, sturdy heel that aids in stability and balance during dance movements. Similar to the female flamenco shoes, these boots have hard soles for producing the characteristic percussive sounds. It is important to note that there are also some modern flamenco shoe styles available for men that share design similarities with female flamenco heels. Despite this, there remain key differences in the overall design and aesthetic, ensuring that the shoes cater to the specific requirements of male and female flamenco dancers. In conclusion, the original statement is incorrect, as male and female flamenco dancers do not wear the same shoes. The differences in design and style are reflective of the unique performance demands of each gender, paying close attention to factors such as support, stability, sound production, and aesthetic design."},{"prompt":"Q:Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What do you do to weapons when you want to gather them?

Given the question: Given the below context: The \\"ship portrait\\" had a long history in maritime art, from medieval seals and coins to early engravings in the 15th century, and the plain side-on view of a ship under sail, often with no crew shown, was well established as the most effective way of recording the build of vessels. The Anthony Roll belongs to a genre of works that was intended to serve a dual role for the king and the military leadership: as reasonably informative overviews listing details of ships or strategic areas of coastlines they could be studied to determine strengths and weaknesses, and as boastful and lively depictions of Tudor military might they could be used to flatter the king, impress courtiers and impose martial authority on foreign ambassadors. Contemporary maps, or \\"plats\\", were routinely decorated with detailed pictures of ships, to mark bodies of water as much as to liven up the scenes. Such maps were common at the time, and were even embellished by artists if deemed too simple or drab. The navy was expanded during Henry VIII's reign, and he was known to take an interest in warships, as can be seen by the epic painting Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover which portrayed, if rather unrealistically, the ships that took the 29-year-old king to the summit meeting with Francis I of France at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. This painting, recently dated to around 1545, has also been suggested as a likely source of inspiration to Anthony for his illustrations.There are three such plats depicting naval actions and expeditions that are attributed to Anthony: the route of Anne of Cleves from the Low Countries to England (1539), a French attack on a coastal fort (date unknown) and a French raid on Brighton (July 1545). The design of the ships in these paintings, especially that of the Brighton raid, closely match those in the rolls. It is not known exactly when work on the rolls began nor when it was finished. It is only certain that it was presented to the king the year it was dated, 1546. The inclusion of the Mary Rose that... Guess a valid title for it!

Penney had four stores in 1908, 312 in 1920, and 1452 in 1930. Sears, Roebuck & Company, a giant mail-order house, opened its first eight retail stores in 1925, and operated 338 by 1930, and 595 by 1940. The chains reached a middle-class audience, that was more interested in value than in upscale fashions. Sears was a pioneer in creating department stores that catered to men as well as women, especially with lines of hardware and building materials. It deemphasized the latest fashions in favor of practicality and durability, and allowed customers to select goods without the aid of a clerk. Its stores were oriented to motorists – set apart from existing business districts amid residential areas occupied by their target audience; had ample, free, off-street parking; and communicated a clear corporate identity. In the 1930s, the company designed fully air-conditioned, \\"windowless\\" stores whose layout was driven wholly by merchandising concerns.

Here is a question about this article: During the earlier medieval period, the vocal music from the liturgical genre, predominantly Gregorian chant, was monophonic, using a single, unaccompanied vocal melody line. Polyphonic vocal genres, which used multiple independent vocal melodies, began to develop during the high medieval era, becoming prevalent by the later 13th and early 14th century. What is the answer to this question: What word means using a single unaccompanied vocal melody line?","completion":"The word that means using a single unaccompanied vocal melody line is \\"monophonic.\\" Monophonic music consists of a single melodic line without harmonies or chords, and it stands in contrast to polyphonic music, which incorporates multiple independent melodies that harmonize or intertwine. In the earlier medieval period, Gregorian chant was a prominent example of monophonic music within the liturgical genre, as it featured a single melodic line sung by the choir or soloists without any harmonization or instrumental accompaniment.

Over the years, their friendship has continued to flourish, and they've developed a strong bond based on their mutual love for the intricate and delicate process of painting models. Ryan, on the other hand, doesn't quite understand the appeal of this hobby or the time and effort it requires. He's not inherently unsupportive of Jimmy's interests, but he simply cannot relate to them. As a result, Jimmy finds it difficult to connect with Ryan on a deeper level when it comes to discussing and sharing his artistic pursuits. Brett's support manifests itself in various ways. Not only does he encourage Jimmy by acknowledging and appreciating the fine details and care that goes into each individual model, but he also provides constructive feedback and suggestions for improving the overall aesthetic of a piece. Furthermore, Brett often accompanies Jimmy to hobby shops and exhibitions, where they spend hours together exploring new painting techniques, acquiring unique model kits, and seeking inspiration from other artists. In addition, the two friends often organize painting sessions, during which they work on separate projects but share the experience, knowledge, and camaraderie that the painting process entails. These sessions become special rituals for them, where they find solace in working with their hands and creating beautiful miniature worlds full of intricate details, colors, and textures. Brett also actively seeks out opportunities for Jimmy to showcase his work in local galleries, art fairs, and online forums for model painters. He strongly believes that it's essential to offer exposure to Jimmy's breathtaking models so that a wider audience can appreciate the meticulous craftsmanship and artistry that goes into each creation. Despite the apparent lack of connection between Jimmy and Ryan with regards to model painting, the three friends still share several other common interests. They frequently hang out together, indulge in various recreational activities, and have a strong bond that transcends their differing passions. In conclusion, the friendship among Jimmy, Brett, and Ryan is a nuanced one, characterized by the unique dynamics between each pair. While Brett's unwavering support and enthusiasm for painting models aligns perfectly with Jimmy's interests, Ryan's limited involvement in this particular aspect has no bearing on the overall strength of their friendships. The beauty of their connection lies in their ability to maintain close bonds while respecting and appreciating the individual passions of each friend. It is through their shared experiences, mutual support, and understanding that they continue to nurture and grow their friendships."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Fill a large saucepan, deep skillet, or deep-fryer with the oil. You've cut your chicken into small pieces, so the oil doesn't need to be too deep, but it should fill about 1/3 of the pan. The ideal frying temperature for oil is usually listed as around 365ºF (or 185ºC). You can test the oil by dropping a cube of white bread into the oil. When it browns in fifteen seconds, your oil is ready. It's a good idea to begin with frying just one or two pieces of chicken. This will help you verify that the oil is hot enough and give you an idea of how long it will take to fry the chicken. If you don't want to risk messing up a whole piece of chicken you can cut one piece in half and use that. If the oil doesn't cover the chicken piece entirely, be sure to rotate it after a couple of minutes. If you rotate too early, the chicken may stick, so allow for a crust to form. Once the chicken is browned and crisped remove it from the oil. Now cut it in half to make sure that it's cooked through. This should take about 5-8 minutes. Once you've finished frying your test pieces, continue frying the remainder of the chicken. Depending upon the size of your pan, you may want to do this in batches. If you fry in batches, place your finished chicken on a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels. This will help soak up any residual oil and keep the chicken from getting soggy. Keep the oven on a very low setting, around 200ºF or 93ºC. If you fry in batches, you will need to allow the oil to get back up to temperature before adding a new batch. Your finished chicken could get cold in that time. Once you've fried all of your chicken pieces, garnish with finely chopped fresh coriander leaves. You may also want to give the dish a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. All that you need to do now is enjoy this spicy savory treat!

These guys are genuine giant-slayers, as they proved with Saturday's 55-53 win over No. 3 Syracuse in Buffalo. Sure, the Orange hardly looked like the team that was top-ranked this season, going 0 for 10 on threes, but Dayton defended like crazy and hit clutch shots in Syracuse's back yard. Dayton improved to 11-0 when holding opponents under 60 points. You're kicking yourself you didn't put Dayton in your Sweet 16. Ohio State and Syracuse were two of the biggest second-half swoon teams of the year. The Buckeyes were 15-0, then went 8-8 the rest of the regular season. 'Cuse was 25-0, then went 2-5 in its last seven before the tourney. Dayton, meanwhile, had won its last 10 games against everyone not named Saint Joseph's. If anyone was ripe for an underdog run, it was the Flyers. The No. 1 seed Gators punched their ticket to the Sweet 16 with a dominant 61-45 win over No. 9 Pitt, which beat Colorado by 29 on Thursday. Scottie Wilbekin led Florida with 21 points, including 13 in a seven-minute span of the second half. Wilbekin got the Gators back on track. After an ugly opener, they needed someone to step up, and he came up huge. But the story of the game was that relentless, swarming UF defense, which held Pitt to 19-of-51 shooting. The star of that defense was big man Patric Young. He scored only seven points, but Pitt had no answer for him when it had the ball, as he had four blocks and also pulled down six of Florida's 14 offensive rebounds in 30 minutes. \\"Patric in particular in the first half just couldn't finish around the basket,\\" Gators coach Billy Donovan said. \\"But we overcame that, and I thought our defense in particular -- both halves it was good, but I thought in the second half it really, really was good, and these guys did a really terrific job from start to finish.\\" If the Gators can maintain this level of play on D, nobody is going to beat them. A win is a win, but man, the defending champs are doing it ugly. Louisville had a huge struggle against Manhattan and a very sloppy performance in Saturday's 66-51 win over No. 5 Saint Louis. With Wichita State/Kentucky up next and possibly Michigan in the Elite Eight, it's tough to like Louisville in that region. Saturday's first half, both physically and on the scoreboard, felt more like a football game -- Saint Louis didn't even reach double figures until the 3:44 mark, and Louisville wasn't much better. The good news: Luke Hancock, the Cards' hero against the Jaspers and last year's MOP of the Final Four, continued his hot play in the tournament, hitting four 3-pointers and leading the way with 21 points. Plus, Louisville shot 48 percent in the second half and opened up things late after the teams were tied at 29 with 14:02 to play. Nik Stauskas, the Michigan guard who shot his way into the spotlight as a freshman with six 3-pointers in the national championship game, showed he has grown as much as any of the Wolverines in Saturday's 79-65 win over No. 7 Texas. Stauskas not only nailed four treys en route to a team-high 17 points, but he also had eight assists with no turnovers and even flew down the lane for a furious dunk -- except he missed it. So he's still got room for improvement. But his play illustrates why the No. 2 Wolverines still are flourishing in the absence of injured Mitch McGary, who was the darling of last year's tourney. Michigan is as steady as anyone: two double-digit wins. The first thanks to defense. The second thanks to excellent shooting. With Duke out of the way, the Wolverines have got to be thinking Elite Eight at least. San Diego State and its top star may have flown under the national radar in the Mountain West, but Thames had the game of the day in Saturday's 63-44 win over 12th-seeded North Dakota State. Thames had almost half his team's points with 30, after scoring 23 in the No. 4 Aztecs' tourney opener. Thames did it all for the Aztecs in the first half. He was responsible for 23 of San Diego State's 30 points, scoring 16 and assisting on another three baskets. Thames, who was 9 of 19 from the field, had five assists and ended the comeback hopes of the Bison with a six-point spurt late in the second half. \\"That kid had a couple moves where, well, put it this way, we don't have anybody that can simulate it in practice,\\" Bison coach Saul Phillips said. San Diego State is dangerous, if not entirely schizophrenic. The Aztecs barely get out of the second round, but then they hold the best-shooting team in the country to 44 points. They have wins over Creighton and Kansas, but a loss to Wyoming (?!). They've already played Arizona once and might get the 'Cats again -- just an hour or so drive from their campus. Not to discredit the No. 2 Badgers' 85-77 win over Oregon on Saturday in Milwaukee, but the crowd was roaring for them all night. In a tight game against a very good team, that absurdly pro-Badgers crowd gave them a huge lift. The announcers even said \\"We're 80 miles from Madison, but we may as well be in Madison.\\" Coach Bo Ryan said it was more than that: \\"Do you know how many fast-break points they got in the second half? Zero,\\" Ryan said. \\"Oregon, one of the quickest teams in the country, so you've got to give the players a heck of a lot of credit.\\" No. 4 Michigan State, a popular pick to win it all, ended No. 12 Harvard's tournament run, but the Spartans had more trouble than many people expected against the Ivy League champs. Luckily, Branden Dawson scored a career-high 26 points to help the Spartans fend off a wild rally Saturday for an 80-73 victory. \\"That's one thing Coach Amaker talks about, that we're not just built for the Ivy League, we're built to go past that,\\" Harvard junior forward Jonah Travis said. \\"That's one of our main goals, to match up with teams like that and beat teams like that.\\" If the Spartans get a career night from a different player every game, they will be hard to beat. In the Spartans' tournament opener, it was Adreian Payne scoring a career-high 41 points. This is what we were afraid of with No. 2 Villanova: nice record, but a bad strength of schedule -- 51st -- and a super-red-flag loss to Seton Hall in the Big East tournament set the table for doubters. UConn was just more battle-tested with 12 games against the RPI top 50. Don't tell the Wildcats and Huskies that this wasn't a Big East battle. Jay Wright's Wildcats brought the best out of Kevin Ollie's Huskies, who may now be in the AAC but played 'Nova like it was back in the day. They won every category in the stat book and with Shabazz Napier on top of his game, there was no stopping them -- even when Napier limped to the sideline with an injury late in the game. He just came back in and hit an acrobatic layup to help seal the 77-65 win. Napier had 21 of his 25 points in the second half.

Mr Litvinenko, 43, is thought to have been poisoned with polonium-210 after meeting two Russians for tea at a central London hotel in November 2006. Sir Robert Owen said the full inquest would take place in early 2013. Parts of a police report into Mr Litvinenko's death will be withheld to omit a section about his alleged links to British intelligence. Prime suspect Andrei Lugovoi has since been elected as a Russian MP. Ben Emmerson QC, counsel for Mr Litvinenko's widow Marina, said they believed Russia was responsible. \\"If that hypothesis were to be evidentially substantiated, this would be an act of state-sponsored nuclear terrorism on the streets of London.\\" The death of Mr Litvinenko, a former Russian security officer who had obtained asylum in Britain, led to a major diplomatic incident in 2006 as the Kremlin was accused of masterminding his murder. Thursday's pre-inquest review hearing was told \\"interested parties\\" would receive a summary of Scotland Yard's investigation report into Mr Litvinenko's death but certain intelligence reports would be withheld, including where the Metropolitan Police was asked to examine any links between Mr Litvinenko and British intelligence. By Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News Alexander Litvinenko's killing prompted a major diplomatic row with Russia - diplomats were expelled and intelligence and security co-operation suspended. Now an inquest may aggravate relations which have still not fully healed. The reason is that the family of Mr Litvinenko have been pushing for the inquest to examine the possible role of the Russian state in the killing. His widow told me she believed the Russian state was responsible because of the impossibility of anything other than a state getting hold of the rare substance polonium. The coroner indicated he would most likely be looking at Russia's role and expects to take evidence from there. That may prove difficult. But there may also be difficulties closer to home, especially when it comes to information being released which may show any links between MI6 and Mr Litvinenko which the government may want to keep quiet. Counsel to the inquest, Hugh Davies, said: \\"This redaction, of course, should not be taken as indicating one way or the other whether Mr Litvinenko did indeed have any such contact.\\" He said all competing theories would be examined, adding: \\"The court is committed to transparency.\\" Mr Emmerson said Mrs Litvinenko \\"is keen that the significance of all the evidence, including that which is redacted, is in one way or another fairly and independently evaluated and that as much as is possible should be made public\\". He said she wanted to know if it was \\"a targeted assassination of a British citizen committed by agents of a foreign state in the sovereign territory of the United Kingdom\\". Mr Davies said some foreign witnesses could give evidence by video link. Mr Lugovoi is represented as an interested person but Dimitri Kovtun, another Russian former agent who was present at a meeting with Mr Litvinenko on 1 November 2006, is not. Others with interested person status include Home Secretary Theresa May, Mrs Litvinenko and her son Anatoli, and Russian tycoon Boris Berezvosky. Sir Robert, a High Court judge appointed as an assistant deputy coroner for the inquest, apologised for its delay saying there would be no further delay. A website has been launched for the inquest, which gives details on the process and lawyers' biographies. British prosecutors named Mr Lugovoi as the main suspect but he was later elected as a Russian MP and Moscow refused to send him to the UK for questioning. He has denied involvement. Prime Minister David Cameron raised the issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin during his recent visit to London. Earlier this year the then Justice Secretary, Ken Clarke, wrote to the then coroner asking for clarification about the estimated Â£4m inquest costs.","completion":"The inquest into the death of Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian security officer, who is believed to have been poisoned with polonium-210 in 2006 in London, implicates the Russian state as potentially responsible.

After the divorce, he and his mother moved to Chicago, Illinois. His father, Ray West, is a former Black Panther and was one of the first black photojournalists at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Context: Following the highly publicized incident, West took a brief break from music and threw himself into fashion, only to hole up in Hawaii for the next few months writing and recording his next album. Importing his favorite producers and artists to work on and inspire his recording, West kept engineers behind the boards 24 hours a day and slept only in increments. Noah Callahan-Bever, a writer for Complex, was present during the sessions and described the \\"communal\\" atmosphere as thus: \\"With the right songs and the right album, he can overcome any and all controversy, and we are here to contribute, challenge, and inspire.\\" A variety of artists contributed to the project, including close friends Jay-Z, Kid Cudi and Pusha T, as well as off-the-wall collaborations, such as with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West's fifth studio album, was released in November 2010 to widespread acclaim from critics, many of whom considered it his best work and said it solidified his comeback. In stark contrast to his previous effort, which featured a minimalist sound, Dark Fantasy adopts a maximalist philosophy and deals with themes of celebrity and excess. The record included the international hit \\"All of the Lights\\", and Billboard hits \\"Power\\", \\"Monster\\", and \\"Runaway\\", the latter of which accompanied a 35-minute film of the same name directed by and starring West. During this time, West initiated the free music program GOOD Fridays through his website, offering a free download of previously unreleased songs each Friday, a portion of which were included on the album. This promotion ran from August 20 - December 17, 2010. Dark Fantasy went on to go platinum in the United States, but its omission as a contender for Album of the Year at the 54th Grammy Awards was viewed as a \\"snub\\" by several media outlets. 2011 saw West embark on a festival tour to commemorate the release of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy performing and headlining numerous festivals including; SWU Music & Arts, Austin City Limits, Oya Festival, Flow Festival, Live Music Festival, The Big Chill, Essence Music Festival, Lollapalooza and Coachella which was described by The Hollywood Reporter as \\"one of greatest hip-hop sets of all time\\", West released the collaborative album Watch the Throne with Jay-Z in August 2011. By employing a sales strategy that released the album digitally weeks before its physical counterpart, Watch the Throne became one of the few major label albums in the Internet age to avoid a leak. \\"Niggas in Paris\\" became the record's highest charting single, peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100. The co-headlining Watch the Throne Tour kicked off in October 2011 and concluded in June 2012. In 2012, West released the compilation album Cruel Summer, a collection of tracks by artists from West's record label GOOD Music. Cruel Summer produced four singles, two of which charted within the top twenty of the Hot 100: \\"Mercy\\" and \\"Clique\\".

This process involves: 1. The accumulation of organic matter: The process you've outlined describes the formation of fossil fuels like petroleum and natural gas, which begins with the accumulation of organic material, predominantly microscopic plants and animals, also known as plankton that live in water bodies. When these organisms die, they sink to the bottom of the sea or lake where they accumulate on the seabed. This biological material gets trapped within sedimentary layers, triggering the transformation process. This sedimentation layering is typically fine-grained and gets deposited in environments with low or absent oxygen, allowing the organic matter to be preserved and not decompose fully. The above step completes the transformation sequence, resulting in a complete process as follows: 1. The accumulation of organic matter. 2. Over time, more sediment piles on top of the organic matter, increasing the weight and pressure. 3. The resultant heat and pressure transform the organic layer into a dark and waxy substance called kerogen. 4. Left alone, the kerogen molecules eventually start to crack due to continued heat and pressure. 5.

A metal-halide lamp is an electrical lamp that produces light by an electric arc through a gaseous mixture of vaporized mercury and metal halides (compounds of metals with bromine or iodine). It is a type of high-intensity discharge (HID) gas discharge lamp. Developed in the 1960s, they are similar to mercury vapor lamps, but contain additional metal halide compounds in the quartz arc tube, which improve the efficiency and color rendition of the light. The most common metal halide compound used is sodium iodide. Once the arc tube reaches its running temperature, the sodium dissociates from the iodine, adding orange and reds to the lamp's spectrum from the sodium D line as the metal ionizes. As a result, metal-halide lamps have high luminous efficacy of around 75--100 lumens per watt, which is about twice that of mercury vapor lights and 3 to 5 times that of incandescent lights and produce an intense white light. Lamp life is 6,000 to 15,000 hours. As one of the most efficient sources of high CRI white light, metal halides as of 2005 were the fastest growing segment of the lighting industry. They are used for wide area overhead lighting of commercial, industrial, and public spaces, such as parking lots, sports arenas, factories, and retail stores, as well as residential security lighting and automotive headlamps (xenon headlights). Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: is metal halide the same as mercury vapor?","completion":"No, metal halide is not the same as mercury vapor.

(July 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Set in 1934 Paris, the film opens with Richard di Nardo, a young hustler, emerging from the bed of gay middle-aged Carroll Todd (Robert Preston), aka Toddy; Richard dresses, takes money from Toddy's wallet and leaves Toddy's apartment. Going about his day, Toddy, a performer at Chez Lui in Paris, sees Labisse, the club owner, auditioning a frail, impoverished soprano, Victoria Grant (Julie Andrews). After the audition, Labisse drily writes her off, and she responds by sustaining a pitch to shatter his wine glass using resonant frequency. That night, Richard comes to Chez Lui as part of a straight foursome and Toddy incites a brawl by insulting Richard and the women in his group. Labisse fires Toddy and bans him from the club. Walking home, he spots Victoria dining at a restaurant, and she invites him to join her. As neither of them can pay for the meal, she dumps a cockroach in her salad to avoid paying their check, but it escapes and the whole place breaks out in havoc. The duo run out through the rain to Toddy's, and he invites her to stay when she finds that the rain has shrunk her cheap clothes. The next morning Richard shows up to collect his things. Victoria, who is wearing his clothes, hides in Toddy's closet. When she thinks that Richard might harm Toddy, she ambushes Richard and literally kicks him out. Witnessing this, Toddy is struck with the inspiration of passing Victoria off as a man (the illusion convinced Richard who stumbles downstairs to his friends waiting in the car claiming a strange man wearing his clothes hit him) and presenting her to Andre Cassell (John Rhys-Davies), the most successful agent in Paris, as a female impersonator.

She had been planning this event for weeks, and she wanted it to be perfect for her husband. It was their 10th anniversary and she had gathered their closest friends and family to join in the celebration. The small boutique shop where they first met held a special meaning for both of them, and she knew hosting the party there would make the occasion all the more memorable. She had spent countless hours conceptualizing the perfect decorations, planning the menu, and coordinating with a local band to add a touch of elegance and entertainment to the event. However, the shop owner, Mrs. Larson, was hesitant to allow such an event to take place in her quaint space, fearing damage or customer inconvenience. Determined to make her dream a reality, the woman, Amelia, decided to plead her case with Mrs. Larson. She explained the sentimental significance of the shop and described her well-thought-out plans that took into consideration every precaution to ensure things would run smoothly. “In addition to hiring a professional cleaning service to come in afterwards, I’ll set up a dedicated area for the party that won’t hinder your regular customers, and I'll schedule the entire event after your shop's normal business hours,” Amelia promised determinedly. Mrs. Larson pondered this proposal for a few moments before finally agreeing, her fondness for Amelia and her husband, George, tipping the scale. With excitement in her heart, Amelia got to work. As the day of the party drew nearer, she transformed the shop into an elegant and inviting space. She delicately adorned the windows with fairy lights, hung tasteful floral arrangements throughout, and created an intimate sitting area with plush chairs and a cozy fireplace. The menu showcased a gourmet selection of finger foods, sourced from a renowned local caterer. Amelia chose mini-quiches, smoked salmon canapés, stuffed mushrooms, and various other delicacies. The dessert station, meanwhile, tempted guests with an assortment of miniature fruit tarts, chocolate-covered strawberries, and the pièce de résistance - a gorgeous two-tiered anniversary cake, adorned with intricate icing detailing and a fondant sculpture reminiscent of the couple’s first dance.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who didn't finish the normal high magnification search before Waddle took the periscope? As Greeneville ascended to periscope depth, Waddle checked the sonar displays and the fire control station monitors, but reported later that he heard and saw nothing to suggest that the previously detected vessels in the area were now any closer to the submarine's position than had been reported before the submarine began the high speed maneuvers. Because the AVSDU was not working, Greeneville's executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Gerald K. Pfeifer, entered the sonar room and observed the contacts on the sonar screens. Pfeifer then stood in the doorway between the sonar and control rooms, but did not communicate any updated sonar information to Waddle in the control room. At 13:34, sonar gained a new contact, designated S-14. Because Greeneville had not maintained a steady, slow course for a sufficient amount of time, the sonar data available to the Fire Control Technician of the Watch did not allow accurate determination on Ehime Maru's range or course. Also, due to time constraints placed by Waddle, the ship did not perform normal maneuvers which would be used to obtain accurate course and range information on the sonar contacts prior to proceeding to periscope depth.At 13:38, Greeneville reached periscope depth (about 60 feet (18 m) below the surface). At this time, Ehime Maru was about 2,315 yards (2.117 km) or 1.14 nautical miles (2.1 km) away from the submarine and heading in her direction. Although sonar data began to more accurately depict Ehime Maru's true range and bearing at this point, this was not evident to the sonar operators. Lieutenant, Junior Grade Michael J. Coen, the officer of the deck, conducted an initial low magnification periscope search of the area and sighted no nearby ships. Waddle then took the periscope before Coen could complete the normal high magnification search. Since waves were washing over the periscope, Waddle ordered the submarine to go up another few feet to increase the distance the periscope can view. Waddle then looked through the periscope at the...

A: He felt the possibility of Nazi Germany developing the bomb before the Allies was a compelling reason to help with its development for the U.S. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: Yes, the answer correctly states that the individual in question was motivated to contribute to the development of the atomic bomb due to concerns about Nazi Germany potentially developing the weapon first. To provide a more detailed and long answer: Several factors led to the reasoning behind helping make the atomic bomb. One of the main concerns at the time was that scientists and military strategists were aware that atomic bomb research was taking place in Germany, and there was a genuine fear that the Nazis could develop the weapon before the United States and its Allies. This fear was further amplified when Albert Einstein, the renowned physicist, wrote a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in August 1939, alerting him to the possibility of constructing an atomic bomb and urging him to consider supporting research in this area. Einstein, a German Jewish refugee who had fled the Nazis, was well aware of the potential threat such a weapon could pose in the hands of Hitler's regime. Shortly after receiving Einstein's letter, Roosevelt authorized the formation of the Advisory Committee on Uranium, which later evolved into the Manhattan Project – a top-secret program aimed at developing an atomic bomb. Many scientists who worked on the project shared similar concerns about the Nazis potentially achieving this devastating capability first. They felt that their efforts could deter Hitler from using such a weapon or, at the very least, ensure that the Allies had a response if the Nazis were successful. Additionally, some scientists believed that the development of the atomic bomb was an inevitable outcome of the scientific progress being made in the field of nuclear physics, and if they didn't help to create it, someone else eventually would. They felt a responsibility to contribute their skills and knowledge to ensure that the weapon was developed and used with the best of intentions, rather than leaving it to be potentially used for more nefarious purposes. In summary, the primary reasoning behind helping to create the atomic bomb was the fear of Nazi Germany developing the weapon first and the potential catastrophic consequences that could follow. Scientists involved in the project felt compelled to use their knowledge and expertise to develop the bomb under the controlled and responsible oversight of the United States and its Allies."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lake Burley Griffin is crossed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge (310 metres or 1,020 feet), Kings Avenue Bridge (270 metres or 890 feet) and a roadway over Scrivener Dam. The two bridges were constructed before the lake was filled, and replaced wooden structures. Site testing for both the Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue bridges took place during late 1959 to early 1960. The construction of the Kings Avenue Bridge began in 1960, followed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge the year after. Fortunately for the builders, Canberra was in a drought and the ground remained dry during construction. Both bridges use post-tensioned concrete, reinforced with rustproof steel cables.Both bridges are made of concrete and steel and are dual-carriageway; Commonwealth Avenue has three lanes in each direction while Kings Avenue has two. Instead of traditional lamp post lighting, Kings Avenue Bridge was illuminated by a series of fluorescent tubes on the handrails, a concept known as \\"integral lighting\\". The design was deemed a success, so it was introduced to the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge also. Both structures won awards from the Illumination Engineering Society.Kings Avenue Bridge opened on 10 March 1962. Prime Minister Menzies unlocked a ceremonial chain before the motorcade and pageant crossed the lake in front of a large crowd. Commonwealth Avenue Bridge opened in 1963 without an official ceremony.

Beverly Wyse, the 737 program manager, told reporters the factory plans to step up production at the factory to 42 per month in the second quarter of 2014 and may go to 52 per month in 2018 or 2019, but that the company was still studying that possibility. Can we infer the following? Boeing has a factory in Washington that makes jetliners, of the 737 variety.","completion":"Yes, we can infer that Boeing has a factory in Renton, Washington, that manufactures jetliners, specifically the 737 variety. The information provided indicates that the company has plans to increase production rates for the 737 jetliners at this particular factory and is considering further production ramp-ups in the future. According to Beverly Wyse, the 737 program manager, the factory in Renton has planned to step up production to 42 units per month in the second quarter of 2014. Additionally, Boeing is exploring the possibility of increasing production to 52 units per month in 2018 or 2019. It is important to note that the company sees no bubble in the market for their 737 jetliners. This signifies that demand for these aircraft remains strong, and Boeing anticipates continued growth in sales. Moreover, the production capacity could potentially go as high as 60 units per month at the Renton factory, although that possibility has not been confirmed yet. Boeing's 737 jetliner model is part of their narrow-body airplane series and has been a popular choice for commercial airlines worldwide. By increasing production rates, the company aims to meet the growing market demand and maintain its position as a global leader in the aerospace industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This game would be marked as Dolphins QB Joey Harrington's return to Detroit, as he was constantly booed throughout the contest. In the first quarter, Miami trailed as Lions QB Jon Kitna got Detroit off to a fast start. Kitna would complete a 2-yard TD pass to TE Dan Campbell, while kicker Jason Hanson nailed a 52-yard field goal. Afterwards, Harrington started to get the Dolphins back into business as he completed his first-ever Thanksgiving touchdown pass on an 8-yard strike to WR Marty Booker. In the second quarter, Harrington acquired the only score of the period on a 5-yard TD pass to TE Randy McMichael. In the third quarter, kicker Olindo Mare nailed a 42-yard field goal, while Harrington and Booker connected with each other again on a 19-yard TD pass. In the fourth quarter, Mare managed to put the game away with a 28-yard field goal. RB Ronnie Brown only had 68 yards rushing (with 5 yards receiving), as he left the game early with a broken left hand. He is currently week-to-week and will likely miss the team's next game against Jacksonville. With the Dolphins victory, not only did the Dolphins improve to 5-6, but Harrington also got his second-ever Thanksgiving Day victory and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd touchdown pass ever on Thanksgiving Day.

The wall needs to be smooth and clean before you apply the tiles to the backsplash area. Take some time to inspect the wall where you will be applying the tiles to spot any damages that exist. You should patch holes in the wall with spackling compound or joint compound and then sand the surface if you spot damaged areas. Take mild detergent and water, and clean the walls. You could use dish detergent. Remember that some adhesives won’t adhere to grease. You can also clean walls with trisodium phosphate and water. Look for this cleaner in home project stores. If you spot any oil or grease stains, clean those too. You can do so with a degreaser or a primer if a soft cloth with detergent doesn’t do the job. Let the surface dry before you continue with installation. Figure out where the tile is going to go before you actually apply it to the kitchen wall. Sometimes, it works best to center your tile around a focal point like a faucet. Mark the start and the end point for the tile so you know how much you are going to need and where you plan to put it. Lay out the tile on the floor or on a large table to make sure the layout works, then measure it to be sure it fits the dimensions on the wall. Use tile spacers to account for grout. Put tile spacers in the corners of the tiles as you lay them to create even grout lines. Some smaller tiles have small protrusions called lugs that fit into the tiles next to them to create space for the grout. Grout is a mortar or paste used to fill the spaces between the tiles, giving it a finished look. Start with the spot on the wall that you can most easily see. Then, move outward and upward from that point. Use a level or straight edge to make sure the tile isn’t crooked. You might need to cut tiles if they won’t fit. A tile cutter will work for ceramic or porcelain tiles. Natural stone or thicker glass tiles may require a wet saw. Be very careful when using any cutting instruments. Purchase powdered thin-set mortar for natural stone mosaic tile. You will want to get this ready next. If you have ceramic or porcelain tiles, you may purchase mastic adhesive instead. The mortar package will instruct you on how much water to put in the bucket, in addition to the mortar powder. Mix it. Mastic adhesive is often already mixed by the manufacturer. Let the mortar stand for about 5 to 10 more minutes, and then mix it again. Usually, you will only have a few hours to use the mortar after mixing it. Again, check the directions on the package. There are some mortars that you use right away after mixing. Again check the package for instructions as it can vary by brand! Many people suggest mastic adhesive glue for ceramic or porcelain tiles, and mortar for natural stone or other tile backsplashes. Start spreading the mortar or mastic on the wall where you will place the tiles. You will want to begin with a 2-foot section. Spread the mortar in a thin layer by using a trowel. Press it at a 45 degree angle. This method will make the mortar fully adhere to the wall. Now, use a notched edge of the trowel to add more mortar on it, and comb even ridges in one direction. Working in small sections helps prevent the mortar from drying as you apply the tile. Use the trowel to apply mastic in similar fashion. You will want to use the right trowel size. If you are using natural stone tile, you will want a notch trowel that is ¼ by ¼ inch in size. You may choose thinset/adhesive for glass tile instead or tile with adhesive on the backs. Summary:","completion":"To prepare a wall for tiling, first you need to inspect it for damages. Patch any holes using a spackling compound or a joint compound, then sand the surface to make it smooth. The wall then needs to be cleaned with a mild detergent and water to remove grease that could prevent adhesive from sticking properly. For stubborn oil or grease stains, a degreaser or a primer can be used. Mark out where the tiles will go and lay them out on a table or the floor, using tile spacers to account for grout. Start tiling from the most visible point on the wall, using a level or straight edge to ensure the tile isn't crooked. Some tiles may need to be cut to fit properly, using a tile cutter for ceramic or porcelain tiles and a wet saw for natural stone or thicker glass tiles. Prepare your adhesive. Natural stone mosaic tiles require a powdered thin-set mortar, while ceramic or porcelain tiles can use a mastic adhesive. Follow the instructions on the package for preparing it. When spreading the adhesive, start with a 2-foot section and spread a thin layer using a trolley at a 45-degree angle, then comb even ridges in one direction. Correct trowel size is also important; a ¼ by ¼ inch notch trowel is recommended for natural stone tile. In summary, the correct steps are to prepare the wall, layout and plan where the tiles will go, prepare the adhesive properly, and apply it in the right way, all while paying attention to safety and detail to ensure a neat and high-quality finish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical.

Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\".

Given the question: The black-and-white aerial footage shows a line of purported Taliban insurgents slowly walking along a path in a lightly forested desert in Afghanistan's western Farah province. Suddenly, the screen flashes to white as the men disappear in a fireball — the result of a bomb dropped from a U.S. MQ-9 \\"Reaper\\" drone. \\"Taliban fighters on the run following Afghan-led offensive in #Farah province, #Afghanistan. Video shows U.S. airpower (MQ-9s) in support,\\" declared a short message accompanying the video, which was posted on the official account of the U.S. military in Afghanistan. Subsequent footage showed more Taliban scrambling, in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid the airstrikes. The Pentagon footage was released Wednesday, as U.S., NATO and Afghan government forces were locked in a fierce battle with the Taliban for control of the capital of Farah, which borders Iran. The tweet was unusually graphic. While the U.S. military often releases footage of buildings or vehicles being destroyed, it does not as frequently distribute videos that show individuals being bombed.

A more suitable answer would be: The Stamp Act of 1765 was distinguished from previous British taxes imposed on the American colonies because it was a direct tax enforced through the issuance of stamped paper to cover various activities and goods, such as legal documents, newspapers, and playing cards. Prior to the Stamp Act, the British primarily levied indirect taxes, such as the Sugar Act, through customs and import duties. The direct nature of the Stamp Act led to widespread resentment among colonists, who opposed taxation without representation in the British Parliament.

The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \\"reality\\" that goes beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation\\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \\"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction.\\".

Given the information from the provided paragraph, Benoit is a Catholic French male given name rooted in Old French, meaning \\"blessed.\\" The name corresponds to the English name, Benedict.

As traditional gender-normative naming practices stand, parents often follow the convention of giving a male name to a boy and a female name to a girl. As such, Benoit can be a widely accepted name choice for a newborn son. Additionally, the religious context of the name suggests that Catholic families in France or other French-speaking regions may find this name particularly appealing due to their faith. Furthermore, parents who appreciate the meaning of being \\"blessed\\" might also gravitate towards this name. However, several factors may influence a mother's choice of a name for her newborn son, including religious beliefs, family traditions, personal interests, and a desire for uniqueness. Although the name Benoit is a possibility, there are countless names available for selection when naming a child. In conclusion, it is accurate to say that a mother might name her newborn son Benoit.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What term describes the stance that we are born with ideas that are not developed through experience? Context: Philosophical empiricists hold no knowledge to be properly inferred or deduced unless it is derived from one's sense-based experience.

For example, John Locke held that some knowledge (e.g. knowledge of God's existence) could be arrived at through intuition and reasoning alone.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Connecting with Patients Dr. Paris often treats several generations of a family over many years. \\"He's seen us through two births, one operation, multiple earaches, a broken wrist and a recovery from a serious traffic crash,\\" says Jill Farrow, a 43-year-old lawyer whose first visit to Dr. Paris was as a teenager. During the birth of her younger son, Farrow began bleeding badly. Dr. Paris managed to solve the problem in a delicate procedure. \\"Twenty years ago, she probably would have died,\\" he says. Today, when he performs school sports physical examinations for the Farrow boys, 10 and 11, he is always reminded that lives are changed forever by doctors just doing their jobs. To be a mix of country doc and somewhat adventurer, the 55-year-old family physician moved to Hailey after completing his residency . He hoped to practice medicine there and ski at nearby Sun Valley. Unfortunately, the only job opening was for an emergency-room doctor in Missoula, Montana, 300 miles away. Dr. Paris took it. \\"I'd ski all day and then drive all night to be in Missoula for a 48-hour shift,\\" he recalls. \\"I'm lucky to be alive.\\" Knowing he couldn't keep up with his eight-hour commute , he began taking flying lessons. In 1981, Dr. Paris joined a small medical practice in Hailey, a former mining town with a population at the time of 2,109. As Hailey grew in the shadow of Sun Valley's booming popularity, Dr. Paris's own practice expanded to seven physicians, including his wife, Kathryn Woods, who is also a family doctor. They met in 1986 at a certification exam in Denver when, in a room full of men in stodgy suits, Woods arrived wearing a Lycra biking outfit and carrying the front wheel of her bicycle (which she couldn't lock up outside). Dr. Paris asked her out on the spot. In 1989, they married. Answer:","completion":"Question: Which of the following events has Dr. Paris been involved with in treating Jill Farrow's family?

We have an equation that looks like this: 78407 * o = 74953 * o + 172700 We need to find out what \\"o\\" should be. So here's what we do: Step 1: We want to move the 74953 * o from the right side to the left side of the equation.

Here is a news article: BP and other companies sued over the massive Gulf oil spill are asking a federal judge to dismiss many of the claims filed by businesses and people who say they have been harmed by the disaster. U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier set Monday as a deadline for BP, Transocean and other companies to file motions to dismiss claims over last year's deadly Deepwater Horizon rig explosion and the spill that followed it. Rig owner Transocean says many plaintiffs' claims should be dismissed because they allegedly failed to follow the terms of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and filed suit before properly presenting their claims to BP. Barbier is presiding over more than 300 spill-related lawsuits and thousands of claims, including those by fishermen, property owners and tourist businesses. ||||| The U.S. has approved the first deepwater drilling permit in the Gulf of Mexico since BP's massive oil spill. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement announced Monday that it issued a permit to Noble Energy Inc. to continue work on its Santiago well about 70 miles (112 kilometers) southeast of Venice, Louisiana. Drilling will resume nearly one year after BP's blowout created the worst offshore spill in U.S. history. Noble started drilling the well four days before the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded on April 20. The project was put on hold on June 12 after the U.S. placed a moratorium on exploration in waters deeper than 500 feet (152 meters). No new deepwater permits had been issued since the moratorium was lifted in October. Regulators have been under pressure from the oil industry and some lawmakers to get drilling projects started again in the Gulf while ensuring that new safeguards are in place. That pressure increased last week as the price of oil spiked above 100 per barrel and the price of gasoline hit its highest level in two and a half years. Environmental groups want the government to hold off on permits and force oil companies to further study the effects of drilling on fragile marine habitats. At 6,500 feet (1,980 meters) below the surface, Noble's well is deeper than BP's blown out Macondo well. In a worst-case scenario, the company told regulators its well could spill nearly 3 million gallons (11.36 million liters) of oil per day into the Gulf. At its peak, the BP well spilled 2.6 million gallons (9.84 million liters) per day. Noble had drilled to a depth of 13,585 feet (4,140 meters) before the moratorium and has about 5,400 feet (1,645 meters) to go. The permit is for a \\"bypass\\" well, which allows the driller to take a slightly different path than previously expected. Drilling is expected to recommence in April. Director Michael Bromwich said that Noble demonstrated it is capable of containing a well blowout, a key requirement for permit approval. Noble contracted with the Helix Well Containment Group to use its emergency capping stack to stop the flow of oil in case it loses control of the well. Another emergency containment solution, offered by a consortium led by Exxon Mobil Corp., was announced earlier this month. \\"We expect further deepwater permits to be approved in coming weeks and months based on the same process that led to the approval of this permit,\\" Bromwich said. The U.S. has approved other permits for new wells, including 37 in shallow water, since the moratorium was lifted. It also has approved 22 other applications for activity on deepwater wells that were not suspended by the moratorium. The approval comes as Interior Secretary Ken Salazar heads to the Capitol this week to defend his agency's budget request. He is expected to be pressed by lawmakers concerned with rising gasoline prices about how slowly new permits have been issued. Sen. David Vitter, a vocal Republican critic of the slowdown in offshore drilling permits, said Monday that \\"while one deepwater permit is a start, it is by no means reason to celebrate.\\" Vitter wants 15 deepwater permits issued before he releases a hold on the nomination of President Obama's pick to head the Fish and Wildlife Service. House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings, a Republican, urged regulators to push other applications through quickly. Noble's project alone \\"will not ease the economic pain being inflicted on Gulf families.\\" Bromwich denied that politics played a role in the timing of the announcement. He said there are eight applications currently pending for deepwater wells. The Obama administration is seeking a 12 million increase in the former Minerals Management Service budget to hire hundreds of new oil and gas inspectors, engineers, scientists to oversee industry operations; conduct detailed engineering reviews; and more closely review oil spill response plans. Much of the money would come from higher fees and royalty rates on oil and gas companies. ___ Associated Press Writer Dina Cappiello contributed to this story from Washington D.C. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Alright, let me explain this like you are five years old.

Please answer the following question: This article: Claudio Monteverdi, born in Cremona in 1567, was a musical prodigy who studied under Marc'Antonio Ingegneri, the maestro di cappella (head of music) at Cremona Cathedral. After training in singing, strings playing and composition, Monteverdi worked as a musician in Verona and Milan until, in 1590 or 1591, he secured a post as suonatore di vivuola (viola player) at Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga's court at Mantua. Through ability and hard work Monteverdi rose to become Gonzaga's maestro della musica (master of music) in 1601.Vincenzo Gonzaga's particular passion for musical theatre and spectacle grew from his family connections with the court of Florence. Towards the end of the 16th century innovative Florentine musicians were developing the intermedio—a long-established form of musical interlude inserted between the acts of spoken dramas—into increasingly elaborate forms. Led by Jacopo Corsi, these successors to the renowned Camerata were responsible for the first work generally recognised as belonging to the genre of opera: Dafne, composed by Corsi and Jacopo Peri and performed in Florence in 1598. This work combined elements of madrigal singing and monody with dancing and instrumental passages to form a dramatic whole. Only fragments of its music still exist, but several other Florentine works of the same period—Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo by Emilio de' Cavalieri, Peri's Euridice and Giulio Caccini's identically titled Euridice—survive complete. These last two works were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses, and as such were direct precursors of Monteverdi's L'Orfeo.The Gonzaga court had a long history of promoting dramatic entertainment. A century before Duke Vincenzo's time the court had staged Angelo Poliziano's lyrical drama La favola di Orfeo, at least half of which was sung rather than spoken. More recently, in 1598 Monteverdi had helped the court's musical establishment produce Giovanni Battista Guarini's play Il pastor fido, described... contains an answer for the question: What are the specific titles of the two separate works with identical names that were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses?, what is it ?

The largest moon of Neptune is Triton, as mentioned in the given statement. Triton was discovered by British astronomer William Lassell in 1846, just 17 days after the discovery of the planet Neptune itself. It is not only the largest moon orbiting Neptune but also one of the most intriguing moons in our solar system. Triton has a diameter of approximately 2,700 kilometers (1,680 miles) and is primarily composed of icy materials such as water, nitrogen, and methane, as well as some rocky materials. Its surface features consist of a mix of frozen nitrogen, water ice, and methane ice. Triton is unique among the large moons of our solar system because it has a retrograde orbit, meaning it orbits Neptune in the opposite direction of the planet's rotation. This is an indication that Triton may have been a captured object, possibly a former member of the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune's orbit. Neptune has a total of 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest and most massive. The remaining 13 moons are much smaller and were not discovered until the 20th century, using telescopic observation and data acquired from flyby missions like NASA's Voyager 2 in 1989. These smaller moons are typically irregularly shaped and have darker surfaces compared to Triton.

To provide a more detailed and accurate answer, let's analyze the Spanish government and its resemblance to federal systems. Spain is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy, where the King holds representative and ceremonial roles, and the Prime Minister is responsible for executive powers. The Parliament of Spain consists of two chambers: the Congress of Deputies and the Senate, which make up the legislative branch. Although Spain is not defined as a federal state in its constitution, it has a unique system of governance and autonomy that has some resemblances to federalism. In fact, Spain is often referred to as a \\"quasi-federal\\" country due to the level of autonomy granted to its 17 regions (called \\"autonomous communities\\"). They have their own governments, parliaments, and official languages, besides Spanish. These autonomous communities were established by the 1978 Spanish Constitution, which aimed at granting more self-rule to regions with different cultural and historic identities, like Catalonia, Basque Country, and Galicia. Each autonomous community has a wide range of powers and competences, such as education, transportation, health care, and taxation. Furthermore, they are allowed to have their own statutes, which serve as their regional constitutions and determine the organization and functioning of their institutions. Given this organization and decentralization of power in Spain, it bears similarities to federal systems, where power is shared between a central government and constituent political units. In addition, Spain's Senate, one of the chambers that constitute the legislative branch, is intended to represent the interests of the autonomous communities, reinforcing the federal-like structure. However, it is essential to highlight that Spain's system is not a pure federal system. Its constitution does not define the country as such, and notwithstanding the large degree of autonomy granted to the autonomous communities, the central government still holds significant power over them. In conclusion, while the statement doesn't directly answer the question about the type of government Spain has, it does offer a useful insight. Spain is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a unique governance structure that exhibits some federal-like characteristics, particularly with regards to the autonomy granted to its regions. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that Spain is not officially a federal country based on its constitution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Sinn Féin - the last of the five main parties to publish its manifesto - is standing 39 candidates across the 18 constituencies. It is hoping to add to its 29 assembly seats. The party's top two pledges - 50,000 new jobs and an extra £1bn for health - are exactly the same as those set out by the DUP in its five-point plan for government. Launching the manifesto in Londonderry on Wednesday, Martin McGuinness said: \\"We have had five years of political instability as a result of Tory austerity and also negativity and blatant opportunism by some political parties. \\"My priority is to bring forward and implement a Programme for Government that grows the economy, provides proper public services and promotes equality and inclusion\\" Other priorities listed in the manifesto include ring-fencing funding for frontline policing, ending regional inequalities in job creation and extending fast speed broadband to rural communities. The party also reaffirms its commitment to delivering \\"an affordable and harmonised corporation tax by 2018\\". On health, Sinn Féin is proposing changing the way health services are commissioned, removing what it calls the \\"internal market\\" and increasing first year training intake for GP specialism. While on education the party's doesn't directly address the controversy around unregulated selection tests but it does promise to \\"deliver better outcomes for children through provision which is appropriate to both a child's age and and stage of development\\".

After the demise of the migratory Turkish colony, the northern bald ibis was known to survive in the wild only at the Moroccan sites, although occasional sightings of birds in Yemen, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, and Israel during the 1980s and 1990s suggested that there was still a colony somewhere in the Middle East. Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of Bedouin nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes. Following systematic searches, 15 old nesting sites were found, one, near Palmyra, was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals. Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier, the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago, when a combination of overexploitation of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline.The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round. In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the northern bald ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the Azores, and Cape Verde.Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years. They travelled south on the eastern side of the Red Sea via Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and returned north through Sudan and Eritrea.

Q:Answer the question below: If people use a lot of energy they create less waste or more waste? Assuming that: Increased resource use generally means more waste; electronic waste from developed nations is a growing problem in the developing world. A:","completion":"When people use a lot of energy, they generally create more waste. This can be attributed to a variety of factors, such as increased resource use, the rapid growth of electronic waste, and the need for energy production. Below are some reasons why increased energy consumption leads to more waste generation: 1. Increased resource use: When people use more energy, they are often consuming more resources, such as electricity, gas, and fuel. The production and consumption of these resources can generate waste in various forms, such as emissions from power plants, waste produced during the extraction of raw materials, and waste generated during the manufacturing process of products that use energy, like electronics and vehicles. 2. Electronic waste: The use of electronic devices, such as smartphones, computers, and televisions, has skyrocketed in recent years. This has led to a significant increase in electronic waste, which is often hazardous and can cause considerable harm to the environment and human health when not properly managed. Developed nations have been experiencing an increasing problem with electronic waste disposal, and a portion of this waste, unfortunately, ends up in developing countries where recycling facilities may be limited or non-existent. This exacerbates the waste management issues faced by these countries and contributes to environmental pollution. 3. Energy production waste: The production of energy can also generate waste. For example, nuclear power plants produce radioactive waste, which requires long-term disposal in secure repositories to prevent harm to both humans and the environment. Additionally, coal-fired power plants generate significant amounts of ash and other waste products, which can contribute to air and water pollution if not managed carefully. 4. Packaging waste: A high-energy lifestyle often results in increased consumption of packaged goods. The production and consumption of these products results in a large amount of plastic and paper waste, much of which ends up in landfills or the natural environment. When people use more energy, they often generate more packaging waste because they are consuming more disposable, pre-packaged, and processed goods that come wrapped in plastic, paper, or other materials. 5. Indirect waste generation: Higher energy consumption indicates a higher level of production and consumption of goods and services. This can lead to more waste generation indirectly. For example, when people use energy-consuming devices like cars, they may be more likely to travel greater distances and purchase items that generate waste, like fast food packaging, disposable products, and single-use plastics. 6. Resource depletion: Higher energy consumption can also contribute to resource depletion, which in turn can lead to more waste as companies and individuals are forced to use less efficient or more environmentally harmful methods to extract and process necessary resources. Resource depletion also strains the planet's natural systems, which can become less effective in breaking down waste, further exacerbating waste problems. In conclusion, people who use a lot of energy generally create more waste, due to factors such as increased resource use, growing electronic waste problems, and waste generation from energy production. It is crucial that we work together to find innovative solutions for managing waste, conserving resources, and adopting more sustainable energy practices to reduce our ecological footprint and protect the environment for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fraternity settles lawsuit over fatal accident at Yale-Harvard football game A Yale University fraternity and more than 80 of its members have settled lawsuits over a fatal rental truck accident outside the popular Yale-Harvard football game in 2011, bringing an end to all litigation in the case, a lawyer said Friday. A U-Haul truck carrying beer kegs heading to the Sigma Phi Epsilon tailgating area outside the Yale Bowl fatally struck 30-year-old Nancy Barry, of Salem, Massachusetts, and injured two other women. Brendan Ross, a Yale student and fraternity member who was driving the truck, was allowed into a probation program that erased criminal charges against him. Ralph Sbrogna, a Worcester, Massachusetts, attorney representing Barry’s family, told the Associated Press that the national office of Sigma Phi Epsilon, the fraternity’s Yale chapter and the Yale fraternity members at the time of the accident were the final defendants to settle the lawsuits. The settlements were reached in November, but formal court documents have yet to be filed, he said. Terms of all the settlements were confidential, and none of the defendants admitted any wrongdoing, Sbrogna said. The fraternity and its members had been scheduled to go on trial in the case next week in state court in Waterbury. Barry’s family and Sarah Short, a Yale student injured in the accident, sued the fraternity; its members, including Ross; Yale; U-Haul; and other defendants for unspecified damages. Yale, U-Haul and other defendants had earlier settled the lawsuits, Sbrogna said. “The family is happy to have this behind them, to have some closure to this,” Sbrogna said of Barry’s relatives. “Whatever was gained from this settlement monetarily is not going to bring this young woman back.” A lawyer for the fraternity did not immediately return a message seeking comment Friday. A Yale spokesman had no immediate comment. The accident happened November 19, 2011, outside the Yale Bowl, where Harvard beat Yale 45-7 in the 128th edition of the rivalry. Ross, of O’Fallon, Missouri, revved the truck’s engine in an effort to get pedestrians to move, but the vehicle took off, state prosecutors said. Ross told police he tried to hit the brake but hit the gas pedal instead. Ross passed a field sobriety test after the accident and was charged with negligent homicide and reckless driving. He was granted accelerated rehabilitation in February 2013. The program allows charges to be erased upon successful completion of probation. He also was ordered to perform 400 hours of community service. After the accident, Yale tightened its tailgating rules. It now bans kegs at university athletic events and other functions. Also, oversized vehicles, such as box trucks and large commercial vehicles, are barred from university lots at athletic events unless they are driven by a preapproved authorized vendor.

The proposed state included the entirety of the Gaza Strip and over 90% of the West Bank with Jerusalem as a shared capital, although some argue that the plan was to annex areas which would lead to a cantonization of the West Bank into three blocs, which the Palestinian delegation likened to South African \\"bantustans\\", a loaded word that was disputed by the Israeli and American negotiators.

I also love Georgette Heyer's usual clever dialogue: those heroes' biting irony and their wicked wit. It just happens that 'A Civil Contract' is not like that.Here, instead, we have an essentially gentle story, with a hero who, though a soldier, never speaks an unkind or angry word. Financial adversity forces Lord Lynton to give up the woman whom he loves with a passion, and who idolises him as a dashing soldier, and to make a marriage of convenience with the daughter of the rich but unspeakably vulgar Jonathan Chawleigh.

Article:","completion":"Title: Michael Johnson, 22, Charged with Exposing Gay Lover to HIV; Police Discover 32 Sex Tapes with Unidentified Men Introduction: Michael Johnson, a 22-year-old from St. Charles, Missouri was recently charged with exposing his gay lover to HIV. The case has taken further a disturbing turn after the police discovered 32 explicit sex tapes featuring Johnson with several unidentified men. The investigation began after an individual claimed to have contracted HIV from Johnson. Body: The emergence of the sex tapes has shed light on the many encounters Johnson had with numerous people involved in the explicit acts. The recordings were primarily made in a room at Lindenwood University in St. Charles, Missouri, according to the police. Among the tapes, 31 unidentified men can be seen engaging in sexual activity with Johnson. Since these individuals are not aware of Johnson's HIV status, the authorities are working to uncover their identities to mitigate the spread of the virus and protect public health. The investigation was prompted after a man claimed to have caught HIV from Johnson. This allegation led to a thorough search and subsequent discovery of the sex tapes, all of which are now playing a crucial role in developing the case against Johnson. As the authorities continue their efforts to identify the men involved in the tapes, the potential number of individuals exposed to HIV by Johnson raises significant concerns about the broader implications of this case. Authorities are also urging any individuals who have had sexual contact with Johnson to come forward and get tested for HIV, as well as to help in identifying other potentially affected people. Conclusion: The unfolding case of Michael Johnson, now facing charges for exposing his gay lover to HIV, highlights the importance of practicing safe sex and being informed about one's health status. Awareness and open communication about sexually transmitted infections are crucial in preventing their spread and limiting the potential impact on others. As the investigation continues, it is essential for anyone who may have been exposed to Johnson to take the necessary steps to protect their health and well-being. In summary, Michael Johnson's actions have exposed many to the risks associated with HIV. Authorities must act quickly and efficiently to identify the 31 unidentified men in the tapes to address the pressing health concerns and bring justice for those involved in this alarming case. The situation serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding one's health and practicing safe sex to protect oneself and others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is always wise to check the official government websites and stay up-to-date on any travel policy changes. When planning your solo trip to Paris, take time to craft a well-thought-out itinerary that accommodates your interests, budget, and time constraints. From iconic tourist attractions like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum to hidden gems such as Canal Saint-Martin and the Paris Catacombs, the City of Light offers endless opportunities for adventure and cultural experiences. Before embarking on your trip, make sure to book your flight tickets and accommodation ahead of time. Look for reputable websites and airlines offering the best deals and value for your money.

Given equation: 396*h - 32935 = -52*h - 493*h We can combine the terms with h on the right side of the equation. -52*h - 493*h = (-52 - 493)*h = -545*h Now, the equation becomes: 396*h - 32935 = -545*h Step 2: Move variables (terms containing h) to one side of the equation. To do this, we will add 545*h on both sides of the equation to isolate h terms on one side. 396*h + 545*h - 32935 = -545*h + 545*h Combining the h terms on the left side: (396 + 545)*h - 32935 = 0 Combining the numbers: 941*h - 32935 = 0 Step 3: Isolate h term.

First question: When 50ml of 0.2 N H2SO4 is mixed with 50ml of 1 N KOH, the heat liberated is? Let's break it down. There are two liquids being mixed here: H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) and KOH (potassium hydroxide). Each liquid has a specific concentration (N), which tells us how strong they are. When these two liquids mix, there's a reaction, and this reaction creates heat (energy). The question is asking how much heat is produced (liberated) by mixing these two liquids. Second question: What does 0.08 weigh? This question is very different from the first one. It's asking for the weight of something that's given as 0.08 (maybe grams, pounds, or another unit of weight). But we don't know what it is, so we can't give an answer without more information.

Does \\"In 944 the Rus' force advanced again on the Greeks, by land and sea, and a Byzantine force from Cherson responded.\\" correctly answer the question of Where did Igor get warriors from after returning to Kiev after being drivin out by the Byzatines?","completion":"No, the statement \\"In 944 the Rus' force advanced again on the Greeks, by land and sea, and a Byzantine force from Cherson responded.\\" does not directly answer the question of where Igor got warriors from after returning to Kiev after being driven out by the Byzantines. While the statement mentions the Rus' force advancing on the Greeks again in 944, it does not specifically address the source of the warriors that Igor gathered. To provide a more detailed and relevant answer to the question: Igor of Kiev, also known as Igor I, was a Varangian ruler of the Kievan Rus' during the 10th century. After being driven out by the Byzantines in the early 940s, Igor had to reassemble his army in order to gather enough forces for a new campaign. To obtain warriors after his initial defeat, Igor turned to several possible sources: 1. Local Slavic tribes: As the ruler of the Kievan Rus', Igor would have been able to draw upon the many Slavic tribes under his rule to replenish his army. These tribes, which included the Polans, Drevlians, Severians, and others, would have been a significant source of manpower for Igor's new military campaign. 2. Varangian mercenaries: The Varangians were an elite warrior class of Norse origin who often served as mercenaries for various rulers around the Baltic Sea and Eastern Europe. It is likely that Igor, himself being a Varangian, would have been able to recruit more of these skilled fighters to bolster his forces. 3. Khazar and Pecheneg allies: Igor may have also sought military assistance from neighboring powers, such as the Khazars and Pechenegs. Both of these groups were known to have been involved in various conflicts with the Byzantines and could have seen an opportunity to weaken their common enemy by supporting Igor's new campaign. 4. Diplomacy and tribute: Some sources suggest that Igor may have engaged in diplomatic efforts to gather warriors, possibly by promising land, status or rewards to those who fought alongside his forces. Additionally, he may have demanded or negotiated for military assistance from the tribes and clans under his rule as part of their tributary obligations. Utilizing a combination of these sources, Igor was able to rebuild his army and launch another attack against the Byzantine Empire in 944. During this campaign, the Rus' force, comprised of both land and naval units, advanced on the Greek territories. In response, the Byzantines sent a force from Cherson to confront Igor's forces, ultimately concluding the conflict through negotiations and a favorable treaty for the Kievan Rus'. Nevertheless, the specific composition of Igor's forces in this campaign remains a topic of historical debate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He quickly gets used to the city and its people, but finds it under curfew. When he shelters in a nearby tent, a witch (whom the audience later learns is Zenobia) summons a trio of ghouls, which emerge from a fire. Sinbad disposes of the ghouls. Meanwhile, Farah and Kassim's evil stepmother, Zenobia (Margaret Whiting), turn Kassim into a baboon (one of Harryhausen's stop-motion creations) just as he was going to be crowned caliph. If Kassim cannot regain his human form within seven moons, then Zenobia's son Rafi will be caliph instead. Sinbad meets with Farah, who believes Kassim's curse is one of Zenobia's spells. Sinbad, Farah, and the baboon Kassim set off to find the old Greek alchemist named Melanthius (Patrick Troughton), a hermit of on the island of Casgar, who is said to know how to break the spell. Zenobia and her son, Rafi (Kurt Christian), follow in a boat propelled by the robotic bronze Minoton, a magical creature created by the sorceress which looks like a Minotaur. During the voyage, Farah proves to be the only person capable of calming the baboon. Sinbad is convinced that the baboon is Kassim after he witnesses it playing chess with Farah. Sinbad and Farah land at Casgar and find Melanthius and his daughter Dione (Taryn Power), who agree to help them. Melanthius says they must travel to the land of Hyperborea where the ancient civilization of the Arimaspi once existed. On the way to Hyperborea, Melanthius and Dione also become convinced that the baboon is Kassim. Zenobia uses a potion to transform herself into a gull to spy on Sinbad. Once aboard his ship, she turns into a miniature human and listens in as Melanthius tells Sinbad how to cure Kassim. Alerted by Kassim, Melanthius and Sinbad capture Zenobia.

Available options: (i) Jill's parents scolded her for skipping class. (ii) Jill's parents took her to Disney World.","completion":"To determine the most likely outcome, let's examine both options: (i) Jill's parents scolded her for skipping class. Considering Jill skipped school, which is a breach of her student responsibilities and an act of disobedience, it is very likely that her parents would scold her for this behavior. Most parents would expect their child to attend school and might worry or be upset about the consequences of skipping class, thus making this option very plausible. (ii) Jill's parents took her to Disney World. This option seems highly unlikely, as taking Jill to an amusement park would not address her skipping school and could instead be seen as a reward for her misbehavior. Most parents would not take their child to Disney World as a response to them skipping class, as this would not encourage better behavior and responsibility in the future.

In regular writing, spaces are essential components as they organize words, making it easier for readers to comprehend and distinguish separate ideas. Removing spaces can lead to confusion and a challenging reading experience, as the visual flow would be disrupted, making it difficult to identify different words quickly. This becomes especially problematic in longer texts, where spaces play a crucial role in understanding the context and meaning of sentences. Additionally, spaces contribute to the visual aspect of text layout, providing a comfortable structure for the reader's eyes to follow. Removing spaces minimizes the white space on the page, cluttering the text and ultimately reducing the overall appearance of the passage.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the name of the person who took photos of Arnett's bloodied face? American pressmen had been alerted to an upcoming Buddhist demonstration to coincide with Double Seven Day at Chanatareansey Pagoda in the north of Saigon. The nine-man group, which included Arnett, Browne, AP photographer Horst Faas, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer and photographer Joseph Masraf waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhist monks, numbering around 300, filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngo Dinh Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around 20 centimetres (8 in) taller than the average Vietnamese policeman. He waded into the fracas swinging his arms, reportedly saying \\"Get back, get back, you sons of bitches, or I'll beat the shit out of you!\\" Nhu's men ran away without waiting for a Vietnamese translation, but not before Browne had clambered up a power pole and taken photos of Arnett's bloodied face. The police smashed Browne's camera, but his photographic film survived the impact. The other journalists were jostled and rocks were thrown at them. Photos of Arnett's bloodied face were circulated in US newspapers and caused further ill-feeling towards Diem's regime, with the images of the burning Thich Quang Duc on the front pages still fresh in the minds of the public.

Q: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Many foreign armies warred against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces, yet many volunteer foreigners fought in both sides of the Russian Civil War. Other nationalist and regional political groups also participated in the war, including the Ukrainian nationalist Green Army, the Ukrainian anarchist Black Army and Black Guards, and warlords such as Ungern von Sternberg. The most intense fighting took place from 1918 to 1920. Major military operations ended on 25 October 1922 when the Red Army occupied Vladivostok, previously held by the Provisional Priamur Government. The last enclave of the White Forces was the Ayano-Maysky District on the Pacific coast. The majority of the fighting ended in 1920 with the defeat of General Pyotr Wrangel in the Crimea, but a notable resistance in certain areas continued until 1923 (e.g., Kronstadt Uprising, Tambov Rebellion, Basmachi Revolt, and the final resistance of the White movement in the Far East).","completion":"The given context does not provide any information about the Union of Working Peasants, so it is not possible to extract the answer to the question from the provided text."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Take a look outside and watch Jupiter and moon meet up The bright planet Jupiter will shine near the moon on Wednesday night and could dazzle skywatchers with clear night skies. This view shows how Jupiter and the moon will appear in the eastern night sky on Dec. 18 at 8 pm local time for observers in midnorthern latitudes. Step outside Wednesday evening and look to the east-northeast sky for a surprising celestial sight. If you're outside around 6:30 p.m. EST and weather permits, the first striking view you might get is the moon. It will be one night past full phase, but look more closely and shining prominently to the moon’s left will be a dazzling silvery-white, non-twinkling “star.” As the evening wears on, both the moon and its brilliant companion will appear to ascend the sky side by side. This cosmic companion is not a star, but the largest planet in our solar system: Jupiter. [Amazing Night Sky Photos of December 2013 (Skywatcher Images)] Jupiter currently blazes at negative 2.7 magnitude, meaning that it is three times brighter than Sirius, the brightest star in the sky. You can make a comparison between the two once Sirius rises above the southeast horizon just before 8 p.m. local time. To find the star, just extend a line from the constellation Orion’s belt down and to the left and you’ll come to Sirius. It looks quite different from Jupiter. It appears to shine with a bluish-white tint compared to the sedate whiteness of Jupiter. Right now, Jupiter rises around the end of twilight. By the end of December it will gleam low in the east-northeast sky as twilight fades, second only to Venus in brilliance. Jupiter climbs the eastern sky all evening, shines high in the southern sky in the middle of the night, and is low in the west at dawn. Jupiter will come to opposition on the evening of Jan. 5, when it will also be nearest to the Earth at 391.4 million miles (629.8 million kilometers) away. In fact, Jupiter will be exactly opposite to the sun in our sky. Any hypothetical observer stationed at the giant planet would see the tiny black dot of the Earth cross in front of (or transit) the small disk of the sun, according to Belgian astronomer Jean Meeus. The giant planet is a splendid sight in any telescope. Its disk is striped with prominent dark belts and light zones that are sometimes (in a good telescope) filled with detail. When looking at the gas giant through a telescope observers will also be able to view some or all of the famous Galilean moons — Europa, Io, Callisto and Ganymede. To see those moons, however, it might be best to wait until about 9 p.m. when Jupiter has climbed at least one-third of the way up from the horizon to the point directly overhead. Moreover, Jupiter is near the northernmost part of the ecliptic (it appears in the constellation Gemini, the twins), so observers at midnorthern latitudes see it cross the meridian at a good high altitude and well above the atmospheric turbulence experienced at lower altitudes.

One of his defense lawyers, Bob Levine, commented: \\"I took him to a number of stores that specialized in tailored suits. We found a conservative suit that looked great on him. It was hilarious. He was like a hick, awkwardly fidgeting around and trying to loosen his tie. I didn't care how uncomfortable he was; the suit was perfect.\\"On December 7, while Hendrix and Levine were travelling by limousine to a New York airport for their flight to Toronto, Levine noticed that Hendrix was putting some personal items into his guitar case. Levine then reminded him that they would be going through customs and that they had better not bring anything inappropriate. He reassured Levine, but as they approached their destination Levine confronted him: \\"Jimi, I know you have something in that guitar case. I don't know what it is, and it's not normally my business to interfere, but I know we will be searched at customs.\\" Hendrix insisted that he had nothing to worry about, stating: \\"Trust me, Bob, no one is going to recognize me\\", to which he replied: \\"Recognize you? They will be waiting at customs for you.\\" Soon after their arrival at the Toronto airport, Hendrix was arrested by customs agents who found a capsule of an unknown substance in his guitar case.

P&O cruises - Telegraph The cuisine is straightforward, no-nonsense British food, reasonably well presented well on nice Wedgwood china. But it tends to be rather bland and uninspiring. It is typical of mass banquet catering with standard fare comparable to that found in a family hotel in a seaside town like Scarborough. The ingredients of many meals are disguised by gravies and sauces, as in Indian curries – well liked, of course, by most British passengers. Bread, desserts and cakes are made well, and there is a wide variety. P&O Cruises always carries a decent selection of British, and some French, cheeses. Most of the dining room staff are from India, and provide service with a warmth that many other nationals find hard to equal. Wine service is amateurish and the lack of knowledge is lamentable. Extra-cost restaurants with menus designed by some of Britain’s well-known television celebrity chefs, such as Gary Rhodes and Marco Pierre-White, have been introduced. They are a mix of trendy bistro-style venues, and restaurants with an Asia-Pacific theme. The self-serve buffets suffer from small, cramped facilities, and passengers complain of having to share them with the countless concession staff who take over tables and congregate in groups. In other words, the buffets are too small to accommodate the needs of most passengers today. Regular coffee: Weak, and poor. Score: 3 out of 10. 10. Good quality tea and coffee-making set-up is provided in all cabins. Self-serve beverage stations are provided at the buffets, but it’s often difficult to find proper teaspoons – often only wooden stirrers are available. Espresso/cappuccino coffees in the extra-charge venues are slightly better, but not as good as aboard the ships of Costa Cruises or MSC Cruises, for example. You should typically allow £3.50 per person, per day. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses the cuisine and dining experience on P&O Cruises.

Mercury News blasted for insensitive Simone Manuel headline At first glance, San Jose Mercury News readers might’ve thought that Michael Phelps and Simone Manuel watched the moon landing together Thursday night. The California news outlet’s first pass at a headline for Thursday night’s action in the pool — Olympics: Michael Phelps shares historic night with African-American — was widely panned for being racially insensitive. While it was a historic night for Manuel — who became the firstblack American woman to win an individual gold medal in swimming, finishing tied for first with Canada’s Penny Oleksiak in the 100-meter freestyle — and for Phelps, the wording simply didn’t work and social media wasted little time in blasting the Mercury News for it. Its second try 10 minutes later was better, but still included a gaffe — Olympics: Michael Phelps shares historic night Stanford’s Simone Manuel. History! Simone Manuel wins swimming gold, takes 100 freestyle The third time was the charm, as The Merc went with “Olympics: Stanford’s Simone Manuel and Michael Phelps make history.” The editors also decided to tweet out an apology for the earlier insensitive headline and included an editor’s note right at the top of the story: The original headline on this story was insensitive and has been updated to acknowledge the historic gold medal wins by both Simone Manuel and Michael Phelps. We apologize for the original headline. The story has also been updated. Confused broadcaster says Lochte, not Phelps, wins 200m medley Still, that wasn’t enough for some readers — and non-readers who were just piling on on Twitter — Friday morning, with more than a few calling the apology and editor’s note “unacceptable” and “bulls--t.” In a time where headline writers are at the mercy of Google’s search algorithms, it’s possible that whoever was writing the headline was thinking about keywords — history, Olympics, Michael Phelps, African American — and just jammed them all together.

The San Jose Mercury News published a headline that read: \\"Olympics: Michael Phelps shares historic night with African-American.\\" This led to an uproar on social media, with many users accusing the outlet of pointing out Simone Manuel's race in a demeaning way and not giving her equal recognition as Michael Phelps. The paper subsequently modified the headline two times before settling on, \\"Olympics: Stanford’s Simone Manuel and Michael Phelps make history.\\" The editors of the San Jose Mercury News issued an apology and included a banner at the top of the article acknowledging their mistake.

Article: BEIJING, June. 30(Xinhua)----There are ten times as many Chinese newspapers and magazines than there were 30 years ago. That's when the country adopted the reform and opening-up policy. Figures from the General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP)show there were 186 newspapers and 930 magazines in China in 1978. Today, the country has 2,081 newspapers and 9,363 different magazines. In the meantime, official figures show China has some 600 publishing houses producing nearly 300,000 kinds of books. That's a dramatic increase from the 105 publishers of the past that produced only 10,000 different books. Rapid economic development and universal education since China adopted the reform has helped fuel the need for more information sources. Under the market economy, hundreds of publishing houses and newspapers have taken steps to restructure management systems into corporations listed on the stock market. The legal system overseeing the news and publishing industries in China has also changed over the last three decades. Since 1990 a law and five relevant regulations were adopted in 1990 to govern the sectors. Since it started in 1993, digital publishing has _ . Its industrial volume amounted to 20 billion yuan (2.93 billion U.S. dollars) in 2006. More than 500,000 kinds of digital books were produced last year alone in China, which is more than any other country in the world.

Available choices: a). no b). yes","completion":"a). No While both questions focus on the general topic of earning money, they address different aspects, goals, and outcomes. 1) \\"How can one become part of the 1%?\\" This question asks about the process by which an individual might join the top 1% of wealthy people. This goal extends beyond simply making a living and implies striving for a significant accumulation of financial resources. The top 1% represents a small, elite group of people who have amassed substantial wealth, often through various means such as investments, entrepreneurship, or inheritance. In order to become part of the 1%, one would most likely need to pursue high-paying career opportunities, invest wisely, take calculated risks, build a successful business, or inherit a considerable amount of wealth. Networking with influential individuals, continuously improving one's skillset, and being vigilant for lucrative opportunities also play a role in reaching the top 1%. However, this question does not focus on sustaining a living in a specific country like the United States but centers on the broader concept of financial success. 2) \\"How do I make money to support my living in the U.S.?\\" In contrast, this question is more focused on achieving financial stability to cover the cost of living in the United States. Making money to support one's living in the U.S. does not necessarily require accumulating a substantial wealth comparable to that of the 1%, but rather, earning enough income to comfortably cover expenses such as housing, food, transportation, and leisure activities. To make money and support your living in the U.S., you would need to secure employment or engage in other income-generating activities that align with your skills, education, and interests. These could include working full-time or part-time, freelancing, developing passive income sources, or even starting a small business. Budgeting, managing personal finances, and saving for emergencies are essential practices that can contribute to financial stability in the United States. In summary, although both questions revolve around the theme of financial security, they are not the same. The first question deals with the pursuit of significant wealth to become part of the top 1%, while the second question focuses on establishing a stable income to support life in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: In what decade could one find an \\"English looking\\" pub trend in Canada? Answer: A fake \\"English looking\\" pub trend started in the 1990s, built into existing storefronts, like regular bars. A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Choices: --yes; --no;","completion":"--yes; The \\"English looking\\" pub trend in Canada emerged during the 1990s. This was a time when themed pubs and bars gained popularity, and business owners sought to recreate the cozy and authentic atmosphere found in traditional British pubs. These establishments were designed to evoke the charm and ambience of England, often featuring dark wood interiors, plush seating, vintage lighting, and an extensive selection of beers and ales on tap. Aspects such as British memorabilia, dartboards, and fireplaces were also common elements in these Canadian pubs. The appeal of the \\"English looking\\" pub in Canada during the 1990s can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the British pub culture has long been associated with a sense of warmth and conviviality – something that was particularly appealing during a time when social spaces were undergoing rapid changes due to globalization and technological advancements. Canadian bar-goers were drawn to the allure of a traditional pub experience, where they could relax and enjoy the company of friends and family in a more nostalgic setting. Secondly, there was a growth in tourism between Canada and the United Kingdom during the 1990s. As a result, many Canadians had the opportunity to experience British pub culture first-hand and developed a taste for the unique atmosphere and culinary offerings that these establishments provided. Bringing this concept back to Canada allowed them to continue to enjoy the unique English pub experience on their home turf. Thirdly, the 1990s were marked by a resurgence of interest in craft beer, particularly among younger generations. The British pub concept was a natural fit for this growing trend, as English and Irish ales played a significant role in the history of beer brewing. Consequently, English-style pubs in Canada began to offer a wide variety of imported and local craft beers alongside traditional British beverages, such as cask ales and stouts. As the trend continued to grow in popularity, many Canadian cities saw an increase in the number of English-themed pubs. For instance, Toronto saw the opening of establishments like The Queen and Beaver Public House and The Oxley, both of which were designed to resemble classic British pubs. Other major cities, such as Vancouver and Montreal, also experienced a rise in English-style pubs, with businesses like The Irish Heather and Burgundy Lion catering to the growing demand for an authentic British pub experience during the 1990s. In summary, the \\"English looking\\" pub trend in Canada became prominent during the 1990s. During this time, these establishments emerged as popular social spaces, thanks in part to a renewed fascination with British pub culture, increased international travel, and a growing interest in craft beer. As a result, many Canadian cities saw a boom in the number of pubs designed to resemble their English counterparts, providing patrons with a unique and nostalgic atmosphere in which to drink, dine, and socialize."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.

Just minutes after Donald Trump fired Rex Tillerson on Tuesday, the president was blunt about his long-standing differences with his former secretary of state. “We disagreed on things,” Trump told reporters outside the White House, specifically pointing to friction over the Iran nuclear agreement. “I wanted to either break it or do something, and he felt a little bit differently,” Trump said. “We were really not thinking the same.” Trump reportedly had considered firing Tillerson for months. But the decision - and the abrupt way it was executed - represents a dramatic end to a strained relationship. Tillerson learned of his firing by an early-morning Trump tweet, according to Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state. White House officials disputed that notion, and promptly fired Goldstein. The move left some of Trump's staunchest defenders with mixed feelings. “It’s all very Trumpian,” said James Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped staff the State Department as a member of Trump’s transition team. “When the president makes changes, he just abruptly makes them.” During his 14 months at the State Department, Tillerson had numerous policy differences with Trump - and the friction frequently played out in public. The animosity peaked in October, when news surfaced that Tillerson reportedly called Trump a “moron” following a July Pentagon meeting. Tillerson never explicitly denied the account. Tillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia — including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain. In return, Trump on numerous occasions publicly undermined his top diplomat, including in October when he tweeted Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the name of the person that conducted the Tchaikovsky symphony? Between the first and second season of promenade concerts, Wood did his last work in the opera house, conducting Stanford's new opera Shamus O'Brien at the Opera Comique. It ran from March until July 1896, leaving Wood enough time to prepare the second Queen's Hall season, which began at the end of August. The season was so successful that Newman followed it with a winter season of Saturday night promenade concerts, but despite being popular they were not a financial success, and were not repeated in later years. In January 1897 Wood took on the direction of the Queen's Hall's prestigious Saturday afternoon symphony concerts. He continually presented new works by composers of many nationalities, and was particularly known for his skill in Russian music. Sullivan wrote to him in 1898, \\"I have never heard a finer performance in England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last Wednesday\\". Seventy-five years later, Sir Adrian Boult ranked Wood as one of the two greatest Tchaikovsky conductors in his long experience. Wood also successfully challenged the widespread belief that Englishmen were not capable of conducting Wagner. When Wood and the Queen's Hall Orchestra performed at Windsor Castle in November 1898, Queen Victoria chose Tchaikovsky and Wagner for the programme. Wood, who modelled his appearance on Nikisch, took it as a compliment that the queen said to him, \\"Tell me, Mr Wood, are you quite English?\\"In 1898, Wood married one of his singing pupils, Olga Michailoff, a divorcée a few months his senior. Jacobs describes it as \\"a marriage of perfect professional and private harmony\\". As a singer, with Wood as her accompanist, she won praise from the critics.

He shares his secrets with us as he hosts parties and beds scores of women, all while living it up at the Hollywood Hills home of a middle-aged female attorney, Samantha (Anne Heche). Everything is going swimmingly until Nikki meets a gorgeous waitress named Heather (Margarita Levieva), who, unbeknownst to him, is playing the same game that he is. As the truth of their life unravels, they find themselves sexually charged by a game of one-upmanship that has them dining at fine restaurants and crashing posh parties, until the truth of their lives forces them to choose between love and money. Inspired by classics like Shampoo, Breakfast at Tiffany's, and American Gigolo, Spread profiles a sexual grifter and his prey.Los Angeles serves as a character unto its own in this film, providing slick and luxurious backdrops during Nikki's high times, and seedy, fleabag motels when Nikki has nowhere else to turn. Nikki runs the gambit of Hollywood dreams and nightmares. The supporting cast comprises gorgeous women like Emily (Rachel Blanchard), who is drawn in by Nikki's good looks and charm but is left feeling cold and used. Nikki's best friend, Harry (Sebastian Stan), struggles with their co-dependant relationship, always needing to bail Nikki out when he runs out of women to depend on.Directed by David Mackenzie (Hallam Foe, Young Adam), Spread is an iconic look at the lure of sex, money, and access that Hollywood offers to the beautiful people, and the karmic price that Nikki must ultimately pay to live that lifestyle.

From the fog emerge two pedestrians: King Arthur (Graham Chapman), dressed in chain mail, a tunic and a crown; and Patsy (Terry Gilliam), who appears to be fulfilling the role of beast of burden, and is using two half-coconuts percussively.They approach a castle and Patsy perfectly mimics the sound of a galloping horse coming to a stop. Two guards become barely visible atop the castle wall. Arthur announces that he is looking for knights to join him at Camelot, and wishes to recruit the master of the castle. Unfortunately, the two guards are immediately distracted by Patsy's half-coconuts. Arthur tries to return the conversation to the quest, but the guards are unable to turn their attentions from the possible causes for coconuts appearing in Mercia (England), as Arthur claims that they found them there, or how a bird, or a set of birds, might have brought one up from the tropics.

Found this joint only because of Yelp -- so thanks, guys! Took my neighbor and her 13 yr old and my mother...we were prepared to get down and dirty... Our first impression was that on a Friday night, this place should have been much busier -- it almost made us nervous -- but we soldiered on. The four of us ordered 3 pounds of shrimp, a pound of crawfish and a half pound of sausage -- all with mild \\"hot n juicy\\" (which is all of their sauces combined). Word to the wise, I was sort of bummed about ordering it mild, but we had a \\"tendertongue\\" with us... Maybe I'm out of fire breathing practice because we thought the mild - like others on yelp - was definitely hot enough. First you have to peel the saucy shrimp or crawfish while it's hot out of the steamer -- but then you realize once things cool down to the touch that your tongue is still on fire. We ordered rolls -- and that was the fun part -- sopping up all the great sauce (since they don't use newspapers on the tables, this is possible...) We thought the shrimp was definitely better than the crawfish. They were out of dungeness and blue crabs tonight -- altho had snow crab but we were worried about the texture -- and honestly the shrimp were really good. The 13 year old is a shrimp-oholic...We ended up ordering another pound for him and the cajun fries for us...really good crispy fries, too. We girls all had beers -- perfect with the shrimp -- but honestly, once you start eating, you have to keep going -- because you're so slimed, you really can't stop and drink...I'd say we easily went through a roll of paper towels. And they cleared us up before our 2nd round of shrimp and gave us a new plastic tablecloth and fresh drinks. Service was genuine -- a little flakey and not really clued into the real reason they were out of crab -- but...does that really matter? Beware, it's very easy to miss if you're heading from the Strip westbound -- fortunately it's on the right hand side if you're heading west on Spring Mt before you reach Decatur. Then the easiest way to get back to Henderson is to take Decatur back to the 215 -- another warning -- they're doing some crazy roadwork on Decatur headed south -- so be careful -- the road is badly marked, dark and nuts... We'll definitely go back -- but this is not for the faint of heart, anyone who doesn't like to eat with their hands or has an aversion to plastic. Our total bill came to 70 and change before tip. but we had 4 pounds of shrimp (16 - 20s), 1/2 pound of sausage, 1 pound of crawfish, about a dozen rolls, 1 pc of corn and 1 potato, cajun fries, 5 beers and used up more wetnaps than I'm sure any table has ever before...so we thought it was completely fair.

While you may be expecting warm and sunny weather, it is still advised that you prepare for the worst. Raincoats and an umbrella may be a great addition to your summer clothing. Perhaps, the most popular summer vacation destination is the beach. Each year millions of individuals and families flock to beaches. When vacationing at the beach, it is important that you bring along proper clothing and sunscreen. Many vacationers do not realize the dangers of sunbathing without sunscreen. In addition to sunscreen, you will need to make sure that you have beach towels and plenty of water on hand. For the most part, if you forget to bring along certain supplies you can purchase replacements. Many popular vacation destinations have inflated prices.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the full name of the member of the Wiggles that was replaced the an understudy? ? The Wiggles are an Australian children's music group formed in Sydney, New South Wales, in 1991. Since 2013, the group members are Anthony Field, Lachlan Gillespie, Simon Pryce, and Emma Watkins. The original members were Field, Phillip Wilcher, Murray Cook, Greg Page, and Jeff Fatt. Wilcher left the group after their first album. Page retired in 2006 due to ill health and was replaced by understudy Sam Moran, but returned in 2012, replacing Moran. At the end of 2012, Page, Cook, and Fatt retired, and were replaced by Gillespie, Pryce, and Watkins. Cook and Fatt retained their shareholding in the group and all three continued to have input into its creative and production aspects. Field and Fatt were members of the Australian pop band The Cockroaches in the 1980s, and Cook was a member of several bands before meeting Field and Page at Macquarie University, where they were studying to become pre-school teachers. In 1991, Field was inspired to create an album of children's music based upon concepts of early childhood education, and enlisted Cook, Page, and Fatt to assist him. They began touring to promote the album, and became so successful, they quit their teaching jobs to perform full-time. The group augmented their act with animal characters Dorothy the Dinosaur, Henry the Octopus, and Wags the Dog, as well as the character Captain Feathersword, played by Paul Paddick since 1993. They travelled with a small group of dancers, which later grew into a larger troupe. The group's DVDs, CDs, and television programs have been produced independently since their inception. Their high point came in the early 2000s, after they broke into the American market. The group was formally consolidated in 2005. They were listed at the top of Business Review Weekly's top-earning Australian entertainers four years in a row, and earned A45 million in 2009. In 2011, the worldwide recession hit The Wiggles, as it had done for many Australian entertainers; they earned 28 million, but they still appeared second on BRW's list...","completion":"The full name of the member of the Wiggles that was replaced by an understudy is Gregory John Page.

Dallas Cowboys quarterback Jon Kitna began his pro football career in Europe after a college career at middling Central Washington University left him undrafted by the NFL in 1995. He caught on in the NFL two years later when the Seattle Seahawks signed him as a free agent, the onset of a long career that saw him hold starting jobs on and off in Seattle, Cincinnati and Detroit. Last season, the Cowboys dealt for the 38-year-old Kitna to back up starter Tony Romo. He gave them a lot more than expected – when Romo went down with a broken collarbone, Kitna stepped in and started nine games. All he did was complete 66% of his passes for over 2,300 yards and 16 touchdowns, good enough for a passer rating of 88.9, slightly better than the NFL average. The disappointing Cowboys, 6-10 last year, were a more respectable 4-5 when Kitna started. Given Kitna’s relatively paltry 2 million salary, part of a five-year, 12 contract he signed with Detroit in 2009, no QB in the league gave his club more or the money last year. Coming closest: Baltimore’s third-year man, Joe Flacco, who turned in a slightly better QB rating (93.6) for 35% more money (2.7 million). Flacco, a mid-first round pick out of the University of Delaware in 2008, has steadily improved over his three seasons while leading the Ravens to a 32-16 record and three straight playoff berths. Flacco’s five-year deal was commensurate with his draft status – no top ten money here – but he’s clearly on a pace to strike it rich by 2013. For now, the Ravens are enjoying the bargain. Quarterback rating, the yardstick by which the position is primarily measured, is figured by a statistical formula that works in completion percentage, touchdown passes and interceptions per attempt, along with yardage per attempt. The top rated passer in the league last year, New England’s Tom Brady (111.0 rating), earned a relatively modest 6.5 million as he played out the final year of a long term contract. That’s good enough to make him the seventh best quarterback for the buck for 2010. Brady has since cashed in with a four-year, 72 million extension, a deal that briefly made him the league’s highest paid player until the Colts’ Peyton Manning topped it with an extension of his own a few months later (Manning’s 15 million salary and 91.9 passer rating left him off the 2010 best for the buck list). Like Brady the Eagles’ Michael Vick took a turn on the Best of the Buck list before cashing in big time this season. After taking over the starting job early in early 2010, Vick turned in a 100.2 QB rating for just 5.5 million (and rushed for 676 yards to boot). He was rewarded – initially with a 15.7 million tender for this season, and then with an all-in 100 million extension. Others delivering above their pay grade: Oakland’s Jason Campbell (3.25 million; 84.5 rating) who led the Raiders to their best season in eight years after coming over from Washington, and Tampa Bay’s Josh Freeman (5 million; 95.9) a second-year man who threw for 25 TDs last year as the Bucs improved to 10-6 from 3-13 in 2009. And finally – sometimes big trades do work out for both teams. In 2009, the Chicago Bears and Denver Broncos decided to swap quarterbacks, with Jay Cutler going to Chicago and Kyle Orton to Denver. By 2010, both of them, making relatively modest salaries, rated among the ten best QB’s for the buck. What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses the best quarterbacks for the buck, i.e., quarterbacks who performed exceptionally well relative to their salaries during the 2010 NFL season. The article highlights Jon Kitna, who provided exceptional value for the Dallas Cowboys as a backup quarterback at a modest salary of 2 million. Other notable mentions include Joe Flacco of the Baltimore Ravens, Tom Brady of the New England Patriots, and Michael Vick of the Philadelphia Eagles, all of whom outperformed their contracts and exhibited impressive quarterback ratings in the 2010 season. The article also talks about Jason Campbell, Josh Freeman, and the fair trade between the Chicago Bears and Denver Broncos involving Jay Cutler and Kyle Orton.

The paragraph provided states that Heinrich Karl Ludwig Herault de Seigneur de Hautcharmoy was born in Wesel, which is in present-day Germany, not Czechoslovakia. However, it must be noted that Czechoslovakia was formed as a country in 1918, which is well after Heinrich's birth in 1689. During the 17th century, the territory which later became Czechoslovakia was a part of different entities, such as the Habsburg Monarchy and various independent Kingdoms like Bohemia and Hungary. While the paragraph does mention Prague, which is now in the Czech Republic (formed after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia), it states that Heinrich died in Margaret monastery at Prague, without any information about his birthplace in relation to Czechoslovakia or its historical territories.

In more detail, this statement acknowledges the challenges faced by institutions such as the Commission and the Council when it comes to gathering information from various member states about their procedures for granting refugee or international protection status. The difficulties might arise from the fact that some member states may not have conducted adequate research on the impact of enhancing their decision-making processes in this area, which might explain their reluctance or inability to share their data. There can be several reasons behind the lack of research on the consequences of improving the procedures for deciding refugee or international protection status. Firstly, member states might not have the necessary resources, expertise, or capacity to conduct comprehensive studies on this subject. It might be difficult for them to allocate funds, personnel, or time to such issues, particularly if they are already dealing with significant economic, social, or political challenges. Secondly, member states might have different priorities, with some countries placing a greater emphasis on border security, national identity, or public opinion, rather than on the humanitarian aspects of migration and asylum. As a result, their decision-making processes and criteria for granting refugee status or international protection might reflect these priorities, which could lead to less willingness to collaborate or share information on this topic. Thirdly, certain member states might simply be unwilling to disclose information about their procedures for granting refugee or international protection status due to national security or political reasons. Openly sharing data on these matters might be perceived as a sign of weakness or might reveal sensitive details about the state's approach to migration and asylum policy, which could be used against them by other countries or groups. Regardless of the reasons behind the lack of shared data, the statement emphasizes the importance of cooperation and collaboration among member states and European institutions like the Commission and the Council to improve the decision-making processes and the overall management of refugees and asylum seekers. By working together and sharing best practices, experiences, and expertise, member states can strengthen their capacity to address these challenges more effectively and create a more fair, transparent, and humane system for deciding on refugee and international protection status. In conclusion, the statement underlines the challenges faced by the Commission and the Council in collecting data from member states on their procedures for granting refugee or international protection status. The lack of research and shared information might be attributed to various factors, such as limited resources or capacity, different priorities, or national security concerns. However, fostering cooperation and collaboration among member states and European institutions is crucial for developing better mechanisms and approaches to dealing with this important issue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In \\"Mount a theater production\\", the word \\"mount\\" means to organize, prepare, or set up a theater production. This involves gathering resources, handling logistics, organizing people and roles, etc. So, it aligns more with the artistic or organizational context. In conclusion, while \\"mount\\" is used as a verb in both cases signifying initiation or commencement, the contexts are distinct - one is more adversarial, and the other is more creative and organizational."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Procuring the pork belly can be the hardest part of the entire homemade-bacon process since most grocery stores don’t carry it. Try a local butcher or a restaurant supplier in your area to find the pork belly. Local butchers tend to have better quality pork bellies available than a restaurant supplier. Also, a restaurant supplier may only sell in bulk quantities much larger than what you need. Once you get the pork belly home from the butcher, rinse it thoroughly to remove any blood or anything else on the meant. Pat the pork belly dry and then transfer it to a resealable two-gallon plastic bag. After you’ve cleaned and patted the pork belly dry, the surface will feel slightly tacky. You may also want to trim any thin edges off the pork belly if it has any. You want to place roughly a long rectangular piece into the plastic bag. To make the spice rub, mix the kosher salt, pink salt, brown sugar, honey, red pepper flakes, paprika, and cumin in a bowl. Mix until everything is spread evenly throughout the honey. This recipe is just one of a near endless variety you can use to create unique flavor profiles for your bacon. Other spice rub examples include: 2.5-3 pounds skinless pork belly, 1/4 cup kosher salt, 2 teaspoons pink curing salt, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon maple syrup, 1 tablespoon Bourbon, 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, and hickory smoke during the smoking process (whether actual hickory wood in your smoker or hickory liquid smoke roasted in your oven). 2 1/2 pounds skin-on pork belly, 2 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt, 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar, a tablespoon black peppercorns, 1 teaspoon fennel seed, 1 teaspoon caraway seed, 1 teaspoon dried rosemary, 1 teaspoon dried thyme, 2 bay leaves, 1 clove garlic, finely chopped. 1 pound of pork belly, 1 1/2 teaspoons Morton's kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon pink curing salt, 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce, 2 tablespoons honey, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon powdered ginger, 1 teaspoon powdered garlic, 1 teaspoon Sriracha or other hot sauce, 1/4 teaspoon 5 spice powder, and 2 tablespoons water. You’ll have enough of the spice rub to evenly coat the until piece of pork belly. Roll the mix around with the pork belly in the plastic bag until everything is coated. Seal the plastic bag and place it in the refrigerator. You’ll flip the bag once a day to keep the even coating, and the process will take approximately 7-10 days. The duration ultimately depends on the thickness of the pork belly. A thin belly (around 1.5 inches thick) will take seven days while a thicker belly (2-3 inches) will take the entire ten days. You can test how cured the pork belly is by touching it when you think it’s close to ready. The cured meat will be firm to the touch all over like a cooked steak. If it still feels spongy and soft, then it needs more time. Once the meat has cured, you can remove it from the bag and rinse it thoroughly. Discard any solids from the rub on the meat as well. Pat the meat dry once you have rinsed it well. After thoroughly rinsing the meat, you will need to refrigerate it again. Refrigerate it uncovered for a full forty-eight hours. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article is about making homemade bacon using a piece of meat called pork belly. It explains that you might need to go to a local butcher to find pork belly, and gives instructions on how to clean it, put it in a plastic bag, and prepare a special mix of spices called a spice rub to flavor the bacon. The article also gives different examples of spice rubs you can use. After preparing the pork belly with the spice rub, it needs to stay in the refrigerator and be flipped daily for 7-10 days.

You are given a new situation: Albert is a scientist who travels the planet looking for new species to discover and analyze. While on a safari in Australia, Albert discovered two new species of live-bearing tetrapods. In the first species, species C, the females had long gestational periods. In the second species, species D, the females had short gestational periods. and a hint : From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. Please answer this question : Which species will have shorter living individuals? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided and the correlations inferred by Aristotle, we can determine the following: 1. Lifespan increases with gestation period. 2. Species C has a longer gestational period than species D. Given these facts, we can conclude that species C will likely have a longer lifespan than species D due to its longer gestational period.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a better root system can have a direct or indirect effect on the process. A more efficient root system would enable the plants to absorb water and minerals more effectively and in greater amounts. This would result in an increase in the rate at which these resources are available for the process of photosynthesis. Consequently, with more resources at hand, the plants can potentially convert more of these inputs into sugars and produce more oxygen as a byproduct. Indirectly, a better root system may help the plant to be more resistant to environmental challenges, such as drought or nutrient-poor soil. This can lead to a more stable and continuous supply of resources for photosynthesis, thus increasing the overall production of sugars and oxygen over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the man who was arrested after the Yeomanry charged into a crowd, killing a child? , can you please find it? The Peterloo Massacre took place at St Peter's Field, Manchester, England, on 16 August 1819, when cavalry charged into a crowd of 60,000–80,000 who had gathered to demand the reform of parliamentary representation. The end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had resulted in periods of famine and chronic unemployment, exacerbated by the introduction of the first of the Corn Laws. By the beginning of 1819, the pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the relative lack of suffrage in Northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism. In response, the Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for parliamentary reform, organised a demonstration to be addressed by the well-known radical orator Henry Hunt. Shortly after the meeting began, local magistrates called on the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry to arrest Hunt and several others on the hustings with him. The Yeomanry charged into the crowd, knocking down a woman and killing a child, and finally apprehending Hunt. The 15th Hussars were then summoned by the magistrate, Mr Hulton, to disperse the crowd. They charged with sabres drawn, and in the ensuing confusion, 18 people were killed and 400–700 were injured. The massacre was given the name Peterloo in an ironic comparison to the Battle of Waterloo, which had taken place four years earlier. Historian Robert Poole has called the Peterloo Massacre one of the defining moments of its age. In its own time, the London and national papers shared the horror felt in the Manchester region, but Peterloo's immediate effect was to cause the government to crack down on reform, with the passing of what became known as the Six Acts. It also led directly to the foundation of the Manchester Guardian, but had little other effect on the pace of reform. In a survey conducted by The Guardian in 2006, Peterloo came second to the Putney Debates as the event from radical British history that most deserved a proper monument or a memorial.

Available choices: 1. Yes. 2. It's impossible to say. 3. No. I think the answer is","completion":"3. No. The given paragraph mentions that chlorophyll is a green pigment found in cyanobacteria and the chloroplasts of algae and plants. It does not mention animals as one of the entities where chlorophyll is found. Specifically, the paragraph states: \\"Chlorophyll (also chlorophyl) is any of several closely related green pigments found in cyanobacteria and the chloroplasts of algae and plants.\\" This statement makes it clear that chlorophyll is associated with cyanobacteria, algae, and plants, but not animals. Chlorophyll plays a crucial role in the process of photosynthesis, which is a characteristic aspect of autotrophic organisms like plants and algae. These organisms can produce their own food by converting light energy into chemical energy. Animals, on the other hand, are heterotrophic, meaning they obtain their energy by consuming other organisms, and do not possess chlorophyll for photosynthesis. Therefore, the correct answer is 3. No, chlorophyll is not found in animals, as mentioned in the provided paragraph."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Background: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) is the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ). Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981.

Process: - Air is taken through the mouth - Enters the lungs - The oxygen fills the sacs in your lungs - Carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled - The oxygen is pass throughout your body. Question: suppose less carbon dioxide is removed happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen reaching the body. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If less carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs, it will have a negative effect on the efficiency of oxygen reaching the body. The reason for this is that the efficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs relies on the balance between the two gases. In the alveoli (small air sacs) of the lungs, oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses into the bloodstream, while carbon dioxide waste from the bloodstream diffuses into the alveoli to be exhaled. If there is more carbon dioxide in the lungs and less is being removed, this can result in an increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream. This is referred to as hypercapnia. Hypercapnia can lead to respiratory acidosis, where there is an increase in acidity in the blood. One of the body's compensatory mechanisms to counteract this is to slow down the breathing rate, which results in less oxygen being inhaled and consequently, less oxygen being available to the body. This can lead to hypoxia, which is a decrease in the amount of oxygen available to your body's tissues. So, less carbon dioxide removed from the lungs will lead to less oxygen reaching the body due to an imbalance between the levels of both gases."},{"prompt":"What type of details about betty lou gerson can be gathered from the following bio?

Question: what protects the vagina? Would \\"The Latinate plural \\"vaginae\\" is rarely used in English.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"No, the phrase \\"The Latinate plural 'vaginae' is rarely used in English\\" doesn't provide a reasonable answer to the question of what protects the vagina. The question is about the protective mechanisms or structures associated with the vagina, whereas the provided statement merely discusses the uncommon use of the term's plural form. A more reasonable and detailed answer to the question of what protects the vagina would be: The vagina, as a vital part of the female reproductive system, has several protective mechanisms and structures in place. These functions and components work together to maintain its overall health and prevent damage or infection. 1. Labia majora and labia minora: The outer and inner folds of skin, respectively, that surround the vaginal opening. These structures protect the vagina and other reproductive structures by covering them and preventing the entry of harmful substances. 2. Mucosal lining: The interior walls of the vagina are lined with mucosal tissue, which provides a barrier against infection and irritation. This lining also releases mucus and fluids that help to keep the vagina clean and moisturized. 3. Vaginal flora: The vagina contains a unique balance of bacteria, known as vaginal flora. The presence of these bacteria helps to maintain the vagina's acidic environment, which discourages the overgrowth of harmful pathogens. 4. Pubic hair: The growth of hair around the vaginal area serves as an additional barrier against harmful substances and can help to prevent irritation caused by friction. 5. Immune system: The vagina is equipped with immune system components, such as white blood cells and antibodies, which aid in identifying and eliminating potential threats such as harmful bacteria, viruses, and fungi. 6. Self-cleaning: The vagina is a self-cleaning organ, discharging fluids and dead cells to maintain internal cleanliness. This process also ensures the maintenance of its acidic environment, reducing the risk of infection. 7. The hymen: In some cases, a thin, flexible membrane called the hymen partially covers the vaginal opening. Although its function is not completely understood, it may provide some level of protection to the vagina during early stages of development. By understanding these protective mechanisms, it becomes clear that the vagina has evolved to exhibit a combination of unique structures and biological processes dedicated to its preservation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Quotations attributed in the Quaker Valley High School yearbook to a terrorist and two of history's most notorious mass murderers — Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi — have district leaders apologizing and offering refunds to families. In an email Wednesday to parents, Quaker Valley School District leaders apologized for “offensive” quotes published in the graduating class section of the yearbook, which was distributed to students Monday. “This is a regrettable mistake, as the school district would never knowingly condone this messaging in a school-sponsored publication,” the statement — signed by Superintendent Heidi Ondek, high school Principal Deborah Riccobelli and yearbook sponsor and English teacher Tamra Rosa — said. “We are well aware of the emotions this has conjured in many of our students and their families, and for that we are sorry.” “Though the content of the quotes was reviewed thoroughly, the attributions clearly were not,” the statement said. District spokeswoman Angela Yingling said students bring quotes in for approval and that “publishing the quotes is a shared responsibility of the yearbook staff, sponsor and administration.” She did not say if students or the yearbook sponsor would face punishment. The quotations in question include, “Words build bridges into unexplored regions,” attributed to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler; “Ideas are more powerful than guns. We would not let our enemies have guns, so why would we let them have ideas?” attributed to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin; and “Be just: the unjust never prosper. Be valiant. Keep your word, even to your enemies,” attributed to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State terrorist group. Senior Dominique Cagliuso said she was disappointed to see the quotes from fellow classmates and wondered how the quotations made it in. “It makes the entire senior class look badly,” she said. “It's also confusing how nobody caught it before it went out. “It's one thing to have a silly quote from your favorite TV show, but to have a quote from dictators is disrespectful.” Cagliuso said she likely would opt for stickers — to be offered by the district — to cover the quotations before her graduation party. “When I'm passing it around with my family, I don't want them to see that part of it.” Yingling said 360 yearbooks were distributed. Costs for the yearbooks range from 69 “but can be more than 100, depending on if the student opted to get their name engraved on the front,” she said. The district is offering students a refund for those wishing not to keep the yearbooks and are offering stickers to cover up “any offensive quotations,” the district said in a statement. School board President Sarah Heres said she is “confident steps will be taken to ensure this lack of oversight does not happen again.” “The board is pleased with the swift response from the school administration,” she said. “We are glad to see options for students and families regarding this year's publication.” The high school enrolls more than 630 students in grades 9 through 12, according to its website.

Answer the following question: The address I had been given was a flophouse called Casa Salvador in the scummy side of downtown, the part where the city's redevelopment (read: \\"gentrification\\") efforts hadn't yet managed to drive out the sundry undesirable elements. I walked inside past the front lobby. I could tell the desk manager wanted to hassle me, but he was too busy arguing with a middle-aged peroxide-blonde woman in a leopard-print top. Her skin was leathery and weather beaten, and I guessed she was the type who was actually a good ten years younger than she looked. I made my way up the narrow staircase that smelled of urine and bleach, going all the way to the third floor. I continued down the dimly lit hallway, past a series of closed doors that muffled the sounds of women faking moans of pleasure. Room 313 was down at the far end of the hall, and its door was already slightly ajar. I knocked anyways, but there was no answer. Pushing the door open just enough to poke my head in, I called, \\"Hello? Is anybody in there?\\" There was no response, so I went in and felt along the wall for the light switch. A single weak bulb came on, lighting up the tiny, sparse room with a dim yellow glow. The room was about 8 feet by 8 feet, and the only furniture was a dingy, unmade bed and a metal foot locker. There were no windows, no closet, and no bathroom. As I stepped all the way in, I noticed a wooden baseball bat propped up beside the door. My watch said 6:20 - twenty minutes late for the interview. I sat on the edge of the bed to wait, hoping that maybe my contact had just stepped out momentarily. After a few minutes, a phone started ringing out in the hallway.

This idea was so important that many countries, like the USA, countries in Europe, Australia, and Japan, also agreed and made similar rules.

What is the answer: With which book did Peter Carey win the 1988 Booker award?","completion":"Peter Carey won the 1988 Booker Prize for his novel \\"Oscar and Lucinda\\". This novel is one of Carey's most famous works and is a significant contribution to modern literary fiction. \\"Oscar and Lucinda\\" is set in the 19th century and carries themes of love, destiny, passion, and faith. What makes this book unique is how it combines historical fiction with elements of magical realism. The narrative unfolds through the lives of two main characters - Oscar Hopkins, an Anglican minister with a passion for gambling, and Lucinda Leplastrier, a wealthy Australian heiress with a similarly strong passion for gambling. The story revolves around the unusual bond Oscar and Lucinda form over a shared obsession with gambling. Despite their cultural differences and the societal expectations of Victorian-era England and Australia, their shared compulsions unite them in a most unexpected way. As their story progresses, the novel explores themes of destiny, obsession, and the destructive power of love and faith. This novel was applauded for many reasons. Its vivid characterisation, rich narrative and the way it deals with themes of faith and chance were highly appreciated. The backdrop of 19th-century Australia complements the storyline as it adds an exotic flavor and helps in creating engaging plot devices. The characters' shared obsession with gambling was an innovative plot element for a period set novel, making it simultaneously unconventional and compelling. The resonance and acclaim of \\"Oscar and Lucinda\\" is further enhanced by its receipt of the Booker Prize in 1988, a premier recognition in the world of literature. The Booker Prize is awarded each year for the best original full-length novel, written in the English language, and published in the United Kingdom. Carey's win solidified his standing as an internationally renowned author. In a broader sense, \\"Oscar and Lucinda\\" represents Carey's talent in creating complex, memorable characters while simultaneously presenting readers with profound philosophical questions. The novel's exploration of love, faith and destiny against the backdrop of historical and geographical settings is a testament to Carey's storytelling skills and the depth of his narratives. This is part of what earned \\"Oscar and Lucinda\\" the Booker Prize in 1988, and has since made it a recognized classic of modern literature."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As a family guide to Disney World, I've been to the park more than 25 times with my kids, and I've developed a few money-saving plans. * Buy the five-day All-in-One Hopper Pass . Even if you're visiting for fewer days, it's a deal (the pass costs 229 for visitors ages 10 and up, 183 for kids ages three to nine and is free for kids under age three). Without the pass, you'll have to pay separately for PleasureIslandand the water parks. A single trip toBlizzardBeach, for example, would cost a family of four 100. * Dine out at lunch. The prices at some of the nicer restaurants, especially those in Epcot's World Showcase, are much lower at noontime than at dinner. It's wise to make reservations before you leave home. Call 407-W-DISNEY. * Become a Gold Card Member. For 65, you can get a Magic Kingdom Club Gold Card (call 1-800-56-DISNEY). Card-holders get up to 20 percent off Disney hotel rooms, plus price breaks on character breakfasts, theme park tickets and goods from Disney stores. * Don't pay extra to see a character. Character-theme dinner shows are expensive, costing a family of four about 140, and even a character breakfast, where Mickey or Donald Duck joins you for cakes, can _ 50. If your budget is tight, try to meet the characters inside the theme parks and at free in-park shows. You can watch the Diamond Horseshoe show, for example, in theMagicKingdomfor no additional cost, while the similarly themed Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue requires expensive tickets. * Wait until the end of your trip to buy souvenirs.

Jericho remained on the side of the WWF despite previously competing in WCW and ECW. However, Jericho began slow turning into a villain by showing jealousy toward fellow WWF member The Rock. They faced each other in a match at No Mercy for the WCW Championship after Jericho defeated Rob Van Dam in a number one contenders match. Jericho won the WCW Championship when he pinned The Rock after debuting a new finisher, the Breakdown, onto a steel chair, winning his first world title in the process.

Thats why you cant slide across ice with shoes. The soles of your shoes are much rougher than skates. The rougher surface of shoes causes more friction and slows you down. Heavier objects also have more friction. A heavy object presses down with more force. The surfaces are held together more tightly. This makes the surfaces harder to slide past each other. Did you ever try to push something heavy across the floor? Heavy objects are much harder to push than light objects. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Why can't you slide across an ice in your shoes the way you would in skates?\\" is \\"Take up more room\\"?","completion":"No, sweetheart. Based on the paragraph, the reason you can't slide across an ice in your shoes the way you would in skates is actually because the soles of your shoes are rougher than the smooth blades of the skates. Remember when we talked about rough and smooth things? It's kinda like trying to slide on a bumpy road compared to a smooth, polished floor. The bumpy road - which is like the soles of your shoes - makes it harder for you to slide because there is more friction or 'stickiness' between it and the ground. On the other hand, the smooth, polished floor - which is like the blades of the skates - lets you slide easily because there's less friction or 'stickiness'. So it has nothing to do with taking up more room. It's really all about how rough or smooth something is!"},{"prompt":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Movie title: Beneath the Planet of the Apes Movie plot: Following the events of Planet of the Apes, time-displaced astronaut Taylor (Charlton Heston) and the mute Nova (Linda Harrison) are riding on horseback through the desert of the Forbidden Zone. Without warning, fire shoots up from the ground and deep chasms open. Confused by the strange phenomenon, Taylor investigates a cliff wall and disappears before Nova's eyes. Elsewhere in the Forbidden Zone, a second spaceship has crash landed after being sent to search for Taylor and his crew. Like Taylor's ship, it has traveled into Earth's distant future. However, surviving astronaut Brent (James Franciscus) believes he has traveled to another planet. He encounters Nova and notices she is wearing Taylor's dog tags. Hoping Taylor is still alive, he rides with her to Ape City, where he is shocked to discover the simian civilization. He observes the gorilla General Ursus (James Gregory) leading a rally calling for the apes to conquer the Forbidden Zone and use it as a potential food source, against the objections of the orangutan Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans). Brent is wounded by a gorilla soldier and taken by Nova to the home of the chimpanzees Cornelius (David Watson) and Zira (Kim Hunter), who treat his wound and tell him of their time with Taylor. The humans hide when Dr. Zaius arrives and announces that he will accompany Ursus on the invasion of the Forbidden Zone. Attempting to flee the city, Brent and Nova are captured by gorillas. Ursus orders they be used for target practice, but Zira helps them escape. They hide in a cave which Brent soon discovers is the ruins of the Queensboro Plaza station of the New York City Subway, making him realize that he has traveled through time to Earth's post-apocalyptic future.

Which fruit has varieties called Smooth Cayenne, Red Spanish and Sugarloaf?","completion":"The fruit with varieties called Smooth Cayenne, Red Spanish, and Sugarloaf is the pineapple. Pineapple, scientifically known as Ananas comosus, is a tropical plant with an edible multiple fruit consisting of coalesced berries. It is native to South America, specifically the region that stretches between southern Brazil and Paraguay. Pineapples are now cultivated in various tropical and subtropical regions around the world for their delicious and refreshing fruit, and they play a vital role in global fruit production. Let's explore each variety in more detail: 1. Smooth Cayenne: This is the most widely grown and well-known variety of pineapple, accounting for about 70% of global pineapple production. The Smooth Cayenne pineapple originates from the Guiana region in South America and was later introduced to Hawaii, where it became the dominant cultivar. This variety is characterized by its cylindrical shape, golden-yellow skin, and a uniform texture of its sweet, mild-flavored flesh. The fruit is both juicy and fibrous, with low acidity, and it is often used for both fresh consumption and canning. The plant has spineless leaves, which makes it easier for growers to handle during cultivation and harvesting. 2. Red Spanish: Also called \\"Florida Special\\" or \\"Kona Sugarloaf\\", the Red Spanish pineapple is a popular variety in the Caribbean, Mexico, Florida, and some parts of Central and South America. The fruit has a more compact and round shape compared to Smooth Cayenne, and its skin has a reddish-brown color when ripe. The flesh of the Red Spanish pineapple is pale-yellow, sweet, and aromatic, with a high fiber content and a slightly more acidic taste than the Smooth Cayenne. This variety is particularly suitable for fresh fruit consumption, as its firmer texture makes it less suitable for canning. The plant has spiny, bluish-grey leaves, which distinguishes it from the Smooth Cayenne. 3. Sugarloaf: The Sugarloaf pineapple, also known as \\"Pan de Azúcar\\" or \\"Kaua'i Sugarloaf\\", is named after its distinct conical, almost sugarloaf-like shape. This variety is highly regarded for its sweet and juicy white or pale-yellow flesh with low acidity, making it an excellent choice for fresh fruit consumption. The fruit's core is more tender than in other varieties, and many people consider it edible. The skin of the Sugarloaf pineapple is light green, even when ripe, which can make it difficult to determine its optimal ripeness. Sugarloaf pineapples are primarily grown in the Caribbean, Central and South America, and the Hawaiian island of Kauai. All three varieties of pineapple—Smooth Cayenne, Red Spanish, and Sugarloaf—are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, providing various health benefits. Pineapples contain a unique enzyme called bromelain, which aids digestion, reduces inflammation, and may provide therapeutic effects. Pineapples also offer high amounts of vitamin C, manganese, and dietary fiber, all of which contribute to a well-rounded, nutritious diet. Despite these differences in appearance, taste, and texture, each variety of pineapple is enjoyed worldwide for its unique and delicious flavor profile, making them a popular choice for fresh fruit consumption and use in various dishes and beverages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Generate a question that has the following answer: Oliver Reed for the following movie plot: In 1929, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini (Rod Steiger) is still faced with the 20-year-long war waged by patriots in the Italian colony of Libya to combat Italian colonization and the establishment of \\"The Fourth Shore\\"âthe rebirth of a Roman Empire in Africa. Mussolini appoints General Rodolfo Graziani (Oliver Reed) as his sixth governor to Libya, confident that the eminently accredited soldier and fascist Grande can crush the rebellion and restore the dissipated glories of Imperial Rome. Omar Mukhtar (Anthony Quinn) leads the resistance to the fascists. A teacher by profession, guerrilla by obligation, Mukhtar had committed himself to a war that cannot be won in his own lifetime. Graziani controls Libya with the might of the Italian Army. Tanks and aircraft are used in the desert for the first time. The Italians also committed atrocities: killing of prisoners of war, destruction of crops, and imprisoning populations in concentration camps behind barbed wire. Despite their bravery, the Libyan Arabs and Berbers suffered heavy losses, their relatively primitive weaponry was no match for mechanised warfare; despite all this, they continued to fight, and managed to keep the Italians from achieving complete victory for 20 years. Graziani was only able to achieve victory through deceit, deception, violation of the laws of war and human rights, and by the use of tanks and aircraft. Despite their lack of modern weaponry, Graziani recognised the skill of his adversary in waging guerrilla warfare. In one scene, Mukhtar refuses to kill a defenseless young officer, instead giving him the Italian flag to return with. Mukhtar says that Islam forbids him to kill captured soldiers and demands that he only fight for his homeland, and that Muslims are taught to hate war itself. In the end, Mukhtar is captured and tried as a rebel. His lawyer, Captain Lontano, states that since Mukhtar had never accepted Italian rule, he cannot be tried as a rebel, and instead must be treated as a prisoner of war (which would save him from...","completion":"Who portrayed General Rodolfo Graziani in the movie that follows the 20-year-long war against Italian colonization in Libya led by Omar Mukhtar while facing the might of the Italian army and their use of tanks and aircraft for the first time in the desert?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm not buying it.\\" can be translated as \\"Jo. To nekupuju.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: - \\"Yeah\\" is an informal way of saying \\"Yes\\" in English, and it can be translated as \\"Jo\\" in Czech, which is a colloquial and informal way of saying \\"Ano.\\" - \\"I'm\\" is the abbreviated form of \\"I am,\\" which indicates the first person singular pronoun \\"I\\" and a present tense form of the verb \\"to be.\\" In Czech, \\"I\\" is translated to \\"já,\\" and \\"am\\" can be translated as \\"jsem.\\" However, in casual speech, Czech speakers often omit the subject and the verb \\"to be,\\" especially if the context is clear. - \\"not buying\\" is a negated form of the verb \\"to buy\\" (kupovat) in the present continuous tense. In Czech, the negation is achieved by adding the word \\"ne\\" before the verb. The verb \\"to buy\\" can be translated to \\"kupovat\\" and its first person singular form is \\"kupuju.\\" When negated, it becomes \\"ne\\" + \\"kupuju\\" = \\"nekupuju.\\" - \\"it\\" is a pronoun that refers to an object or situation previously mentioned or described. In Czech, \\"it\\" can be translated to \\"to\\" or \\"ono,\\" depending on the gender and case. In this context, the neutral gender \\"to\\" is used, matching the gender of the verb \\"kupovat.\\" So, combining these elements, we get the Czech translation: \\"Jo.

Write a \\"(a).\\" movie review (Pick from: (a). negative. (b). positive.).","completion":"I will write a negative movie review for the film \\"The Emoji Movie\\" (2017) directed by Tony Leondis. Review Title: A Dizzying Parade of Emojis Falling Flat on Faces Step 1: Introduction and premise of the movie The Emoji Movie, released in 2017, leaps into the kaleidoscopic world of communication apps and social media with emojis as the central characters. The foray aims to explore the lives of these animated beings that are ubiquitous in our tech-savvy era, but, unfortunately, the movie crumbles under the weight of its unoriginal plot and lackluster humor. Step 2: Discuss characterization and voice performances While a talented cast has lent their voices to the movie – featuring T.J. Miller as Gene, the protagonist 'Meh' emoji, and James Corden as his sidekick Hi-5 – the one-dimensional characters restrict the actors from showcasing their potential fully. The predictable arcs further hamper the experience, offering no real character development throughout the film. Step 3: Comment on the storytelling and script The plot, centered around Gene's quest to rid himself of a malfunction that grants him multiple expressions, borrows heavily from other animated classics, diluting the unique potential of this emoji-centric premise. The script, laden with trite jokes and on-the-nose references to social media culture, fails to evoke the intended laughter and effortlessly falls flat. Step 4: Discuss animation and visuals Despite the potential for creatively showcasing the digital world, the animation merely provides a visual bombardment of recognizable app icons and landscapes without any real substance or flair. While the film designers attempt to blend reality with the digital environment, the final result amounts to nothing more than a dazzling advertisement for popular tech giants. Step 5: Conclude the review In conclusion, The Emoji Movie is a lackluster experience that unsuccessfully attempts to capitalize on the social media craze. With its unoriginal storyline, forgettable characters, and missed opportunities in animation, the film leaves viewers reaching for the 'Meh' emoji themselves. It's a disappointing spectacle that may be best suited for passing the time on a rainy day, but only when all other options have been exhausted."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The group started in the early 1980s with Dennis Condrey and Randy Rose (and originally Norvell Austin). The late 1980s saw a new incarnation, consisting of Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane, compete in JCP and WCW and shortly feuding with \\"The Original Midnight Express\\" of Condrey and Rose. In the 1990s, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) combined Bob Holly and Bart Gunn as \\"The New Midnight Express\\". Due to various differences over the direction of the Midnight Express, Cornette, Lane and Eaton also left JCP for a short while, around the time that Ted Turner bought out Jim Crockett and began promoting the federation under the name World Championship Wrestling (WCW). When the issues were resolved, Cornette and the Midnight Express returned to the promotion. In the tournament to determine new World tag team champions, the Midnight Express advanced to the finals before losing to the Freebirds with some assistance from the Samoan Swat Team. They engaged in a feud with the Freebirds and Samoans until the 1989 Great American Bash, where they teamed up with the Road Warriors and Dr. Death Steve Williams to defeat the Freebirds and Samoans in a War Games match. The Midnight Express soon turned heel as a result of a feud with the Dynamic Dudes (Johnny Ace & Shane Douglas). Jim Cornette duped the Dudes into thinking he wanted to be their manager but then turned on them during their match against the Midnight Express at Clash of the Champions IX in New York. The Dynamic Dudes gained a measure of revenge when the Midnight Express laid out an open challenge for any team for 10,000. After dispatching of a couple of no-name teams, the Express was challenged by the masked Dynamic Duo, billed from Gotham City, who pinned the Express and unmasked as Ace and Douglas. The feud soon lost steam and was forgotten soon after. After returning to their cheating ways, the Midnight Express started a feud with the up-and-coming team of Flyin' Brian and \\"Z-Man\\" Tom Zenk over the United States Tag team titles.

These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities. I am facing a new situation today: Jill and Bob are working on a construction site together when suddenly two wooden planks fall from three stories up. One plank hits Bob on the head and the other lands directly on Jill's shoulder. Everyone rushes over to them to check if they are ok. All the people are relieved that Bob and Jill appear to be alright, but they urge them both to go visit a doctor to get checked out. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person is more likely to have trouble talking? The answer is:","completion":"Based on the background article and the information provided about the new situation with Bob and Jill, Bob is more likely to have trouble talking. This is because the article mentions that a person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage, which can result from an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body. In this case, Bob was hit on the head by a wooden plank, which could potentially cause a traumatic brain injury. The brain is responsible for controlling speech and language functions, and if Bob's brain is injured due to the impact of the falling wooden plank, he may face difficulty in talking. This difficulty could manifest in the form of slurred speech, difficulty forming words, or reduced ability to understand and produce language. On the other hand, Jill was hit on her shoulder, which, while it may cause localized pain and injury, does not directly impact the brain or its ability to control speech. Of course, it's important to note that the severity of any injury depends on various factors, including the force of the impact, the exact location of the injury, and the individual's overall health. Therefore, it is essential that both Bob and Jill consult a doctor to assess their respective injuries and receive appropriate medical care. Nonetheless, given the information provided and the knowledge acquired from the background article, it can be concluded that Bob is more likely to have trouble talking due to the potential brain injury resulting from the impact to his head."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The equation is already in a form known as a linear equation, which can be represented as ax + b = c, where x is the variable we want to solve for. In this case, the variable is c, so the equation can be represented as -16*c - 2 = -2. Follow these steps to solve for c: Step 1: Try to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. In our case, the constant term on the left side is -2, so to eliminate it you would add 2 to both sides of the equation: -16*c - 2 + 2 = -2 + 2 Now, simplify: -16*c = 0 Step 2: Solve for c by isolating the term containing c. Now our equation looks like this: -16*c = 0 To isolate the term containing c, we need to divide by the coefficient of c, which is -16. So, divide both sides of the equation by -16: (-16*c) / -16 = 0 / -16 After dividing: c = 0 With these steps, we've found that c equals 0 in the given equation -16*c - 2 = -2."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One has to wonder, is there any point at which the main stream media and the public get some self-respect and toss out this loser? First he asked for your wedding gifts, then your yard sales and now he has asked for your daughters. Just in case you didn’t watch Obama’s newest ad, and who could really blame you, it’s aimed at young, female voters who may be virgin… voters. The actress gushes about how special the first guy should be and how you wouldn’t want to show up at a party and be discovered as being, “not ready.” Lena Dunham allows herself to be used in this cheap, last minute attempt to be the first for young women. Dunham, who was raised in a wealthy, over-sexualized household and who started therapy at age 7 must somewhat be forgiven for her role; she seems to have a thing for talking about her first time, the Obama administration was just happy to oblige. The problem is, this is an adult man, with two young daughters, who should know better. Perhaps it’s just another message to be transmitted to Vladimir though. Ironically, Obama’s “Virgin” ad, as it has been dubbed, isn’t the first. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin released two ads urging young women to make sure their first time is with someone they love. The mainstream media labeled the ads creepy and were clearly turned off by the inappropriate propaganda. Now the question is what excuse will the media and the left find to justify their president mimicking the leader of Russia. He may not win reelection, but he most certainly has won the award for degrading what should be the highest office in the country. ||||| This is a set of web collections curated by Mark Graham using the Archive-IT service of the Internet Archive.

Given the following passage \\"Evolution had less obvious applications to anatomy and morphology, and at first had little impact on the research of the anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Despite this, Huxley strongly supported Darwin on evolution; though he called for experiments to show whether natural selection could form new species, and questioned if Darwin's gradualism was sufficient without sudden leaps to cause speciation. Huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the April 1860 Westminster Review promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology, praising Darwin for \\"extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated\\" and coining the term \\"Darwinism\\" as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science. Huxley gained influence, and initiated the X Club, which used the journal Nature to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late Victorian science.

Сейчас в Украине стоит вопрос о создании национальных парков, а также нужно брать под охрану отдельные деревья, которые есть по всей территории Украины. Translate this to English?","completion":"Currently in Ukraine, the question of creating national parks is being considered, and there is also a need to protect individual trees that are found throughout the territory of Ukraine. The establishment of national parks in Ukraine is an important step towards the conservation and preservation of the country's rich natural heritage. National parks serve not only as recreational areas for the public, but also as wildlife sanctuaries, and they contribute significantly to the preservation of biodiversity and the maintenance of ecological balance. The creation of national parks in Ukraine would be an essential addition to the existing system of protected areas, which already includes nature reserves, regional landscape parks, protected natural areas, and more. In national parks, the focus is often on both the preservation of ecosystems and the development of sustainable tourism, which can contribute to regional economic development and create job opportunities. In addition to establishing national parks, the protection and preservation of individual trees throughout Ukraine is also a significant issue. Individual trees can possess high ecological, cultural, historical, or aesthetic value, and their protection can contribute to the conservation of ecosystems and the enhancement of urban and rural landscapes. Such trees can often serve as natural landmarks, provide a sense of identity and history for communities, and maintain the balance of the local environment. In order to effectively protect individual trees, it is necessary to establish a monitoring system that would help to identify and assess those trees that deserve protection and to develop appropriate management measures for their preservation, such as tree planting and maintenance, pest control, and regular inspections for signs of disease or damage. Moreover, by safeguarding individual trees, Ukraine can bolster educational and awareness-raising initiatives to promote the importance of trees and forests at the local community level. This would help to foster a sense of stewardship of the natural environment, encourage responsible use of resources, and instill appreciation for the beauty and diversity of the country's natural landscapes. In conclusion, the creation of national parks and the protection of individual trees throughout the territory of Ukraine are essential components of a comprehensive strategy for the conservation and enhancement of the country's natural heritage. By implementing these measures, Ukraine can preserve its unique ecosystems, promote sustainable development, and ensure a lasting legacy of natural beauty for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On a scale from 0-5, where 0 is \\"not similar\\" and 5 is \\"very similar\\", how similar is the sentence \\"A black and white dog is carrying a stick in its mouth.\\" to the sentence \\"The black and white dog has a stick in his paws.\\"?","completion":"To determine the similarity between the two sentences, I will follow these steps: 1. Break down sentences into their core components (subject, verb, object, and details like color and body part). 2. Compare the components for similarity. 3. Assign a similarity score based on the comparison. Step 1: Break down sentences into their core components: - Sentence 1: subject (a black and white dog), verb (is carrying), object (a stick), detail (in its mouth) - Sentence 2: subject (the black and white dog), verb (has), object (a stick), detail (in his paws) Step 2: Compare the components for similarity: - Subject: Both subjects refer to the same kind of dog, so they are very similar. The articles (\\"a\\" vs. \\"the\\") differ slightly, but this distinction is minor. - Verb: The verbs \\"is carrying\\" and \\"has\\" both imply possession, but \\"carrying\\" indicates an action of physically holding the object, while \\"has\\" could potentially include the stick being nearby. So, they are somewhat similar, but not completely. - Object: \\"A stick\\" is the same object in both sentences, so they are identical for this component. - Detail: The details, however, differ by using different body parts ('mouth' vs. 'paws'). The overall meaning is similar, as the dog is still holding the object within its body, but because a different anatomical part is used, this decreases the similarity. Step 3: Assign a similarity score based on the comparison: Considering the similarities and differences between the components, I would assign a similarity score of 3.5 out of 5. While both sentences involve a black and white dog with a stick, the verbs used and the body parts mentioned are not exactly the same but still convey the idea of the dog possessing the stick."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q: Passage: The new Ottoman army arrived on the island during the winter of 1666/1667, and in May, the final phase of the siege, overseen by the Grand Vizier himself, began. It would last for 28 months and cost the lives of 70,000 Ottoman soldiers, 38,000 conscripted Cretans and slaves who labored in the Ottoman siege works and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders. Faced with the renewed Ottoman assault and a struggling economy, despite the prospect of considerable reinforcements from Western Europe, in 1668 the Signoria hoped to end the war by striking a peace settlement with the Ottomans. Indeed, the Venetians hoped to use the imminent arrival of reinforcements to secure concessions from the Ottomans. Admiral Andrea Valier was at first appointed as envoy, but fell ill and was quickly replaced by the elderly nobleman Alvise da Molin. Molin and his embassy traveled to Larissa, where the Ottoman court resided during one of the Sultan's hunting expeditions. The Ottomans proposed that Venice keep one half of Crete, but the Signoria, emboldened by further pledges of reinforcements, especially from France, and renewed turmoil at the Ottoman court and within the Empire, refused the offer. Molin, in the meantime transported by the Ottomans to Canea in Crete, was ordered to continue negotiations and to continue observing the Ottomans' strength and intentions, but not commit himself or the Republic.

At The Washington Post/Univision debate in Miami, Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton panned Donald Trump, vowed to reform immigration and sparred over their respective records. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed in a debate sponsored by The Washington Post and Univision on Wednesday night, the day after a win in the Michigan primary breathed new life into Sanders's underdog campaign. The duel in Miami was the final one on the schedule (for now, at least) and gave the candidates their last, best chance to set a course for the rest of the race with a national audience watching. How did they do? Below are our winners and losers. WINNERS Hillary Clinton: This debate was a minefield for her. She was coming off a disappointing loss in Michigan that gave Sanders some momentum. She got asked about possibly being indicted (!), about whether she lied about Benghazi and about about her being seen as untrustworthy. And the moderators demanded answers. Clinton avoided a disaster and came out as the better debater, yet again. And despite a couple missteps -- she STILL doesn't have a good answer on her Wall Street speeches?!? -- she had some very strong moments that will likely endure more than anything else. The crowd yelled and booed during the debate in Miami as moderator Jorge Ramos asked former secretary of state Hillary Clinton if she lied to the families of the Benghazi victims. (The Washington Post) When asked about her poor honesty ratings and her not-so-great public image, she had this to say: \\"I am not a natural politician, in case you haven’t noticed, like my husband or President Obama.” She added: \\"This is not easy for me.\\" It was self-aware, and it turned a question about her not being honest into an answer in which she was uniquely candid. And then there was the moment she was speaking directly to a woman whose family had been broken up via deportation. Univision's Enrique Acevedo translated Clinton's heartfelt, slowly spoken answer in this indelible image, with Clinton featuring in a small splitscreen most of the time (though not in this particular image): Can't get this image out of my mind. pic.twitter.com/FDw1VD0EHN — Irin Carmon (@irin) March 10, 2016 Bernie Sanders's suit: The man wore a BROWN SUIT. (Or maybe it was blue? No. No, it was brown.) This was basically all anybody could talk about on social media for the first 10 minutes. The Fix is on-record in support of non-traditional fashion choices. Think: Marco Rubio's boots. And President Obama's tan suit. We have seen way too many political men wearing blue and charcoal suits over the years, and Sanders boldly went where no presidential candidate has gone before ... er, at least in a long time. One issue, though, Bernie: No more button-down collars. They should only be worn sans tie. Ted Kennedy: When it comes to a Democratic primary with a premium on getting to the left, the liberal lion of the Senate is bound to get some mentions. He was basically the Democrats' own version of Ronald Reagan on Wednesday night, as Clinton recalled the immigration reform he spearheaded in 2007. Clinton noted that Sanders opposed the bill -- suggesting a guilt-by-lack-of-association with Kennedy. Sanders, meanwhile, assured us twice that Kennedy was a very \\"close friend.\\" Moderators: Look, Clinton supporters and Clinton herself won't like the fact that Jorge Ramos asked the former secretary of state about being indicted. And they probably really won't like that he pressed her for a firmer \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" on whether she would deport illegal immigrant children. But this debate featured something that is often lacking in debates -- follow-ups that demand firm positions. Ramos and The Post's own Karen Tumulty regularly pressed the two candidates when they didn't give a solid answer, trying to get an affirmative or a negative. It's not easy, but every moderator should do this. Candidates obfuscate way too much. LOSERS Sanders's chances at the nomination: As noted above, this was the last debate we currently have scheduled. This was Sanders's chance, after a big win in Michigan, to change the course of the race. And he was aggressive. He tried. He's getting better. He even handled a very tough question (in South Florida, no less) about his past praise for Fidel Castro. But he didn't do anything to change the fact that Clinton remains the overwhelming favorite to win the Democratic nomination. Sanders will likely continue to amass delegates and win some states, but he still needs that game-changer to really make this a race. He didn't get it on Wednesday night. And one wonders where else it might come from. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders went on the attack after rival Hillary Clinton accused him of supporting the anti-immigration Minutemen. \\"Madam Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week,\\" he said. (The Washington Post) Clinton's attacks: Clinton attacked Sanders in a series of ways that are, well, pretty disingenuous. After attacking him for being against the auto bailout at Sunday's debate -- he voted for it but was against the bank bailout -- Clinton doubled down on some similarly odd lines of attack Wednesday. She tied him to Republicans for opposing Ted Kennedy's immigration bill and suggested he supports the anti-illegal immigrant Minutemen. She noted a Koch brothers group is running an ad thanking Sanders for voting against the Export-Import Bank. And she (yet again) suggested he's trying to undo Obamacare by replacing it with single-payer health care. In each case, it's as if Clinton is painting Sanders as an ally of Republicans. In each case, that's just not true. Mostly, he's taking these positions because he's further to the left than most Democrats. Peter Hamby said it well: How many Democrats out there believe that Bernie supports the Koch Brothers & The Minutemen, and opposes Obamacare and auto bailout? — Peter Hamby (@PeterHamby) March 10, 2016 Being a senator: Just in case you forgot that being a senator is not a great thing when it comes to becoming president, this debate should disavow disabuse you of that. Voting on large packages allows your opponents to pick out one thing that you might or might not support or oppose, and tar you with it over and over again. Plus, you are constantly weighing in on the issues of the day in your public comments. Immigration is case in point. Both candidates struggled Wednesday to explain away things that made them sound not terribly in favor of comprehensive immigration reform. One wonders if voters who care about that issue -- Latinos, in particular -- liked either of their answers. Clinton Throws Flash Grenade To Divert Attention From Question About Senate Voting Record https://t.co/FPky1Ka1S5 pic.twitter.com/F1XfSHaoFt — Jennifer Bendery (@jbendery) March 10, 2016 ||||| Both Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders spoke passionately about the desire to stop deporting immigrants who entered the country illegally and to provide a path to citizenship at The Washington Post/Univision debate in Miami. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Both Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders spoke passionately about the desire to stop deporting immigrants who entered the country illegally and to provide a path to citizenship at The Washington Post/Univision debate in Miami. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Democrats got a taste Wednesday night of where their nominating contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders could be heading — toward a grueling and increasingly contentious battle that could continue until the primaries end in June. A few days ago, Wednesday’s debate here appeared as if it might be an anticlimax as Clinton rolled toward the nomination. Instead, Sanders arrived reenergized and reinvigorated after his surprising victory in Michigan. Rather than questions about Sanders’s viability, Clinton faced questions about what had gone wrong with her campaign. The two squabbled at length over immigration. They traded charges over bailing out the automobile industry. They argued again over health care and about how to combat climate change. A quiet start turned into a spirited and at times tense series of exchanges that highlighted their differences and the state of their competition. Clinton sought to brush aside her Michigan loss, pointing to a big victory in Mississippi and the fact that she emerged with more total delegates on Tuesday than her opponent. But it was clear that, if she remains the front-runner for the nomination, she has yet to put to rest questions about her candidacy or put away an opponent who has proved to be more resilient and effective than most people imagined. Wednesday’s debate settled little. Both Clinton and Sanders were effective in making their cases. Picking winners and losers seemed beside the point. From here on, the voters will decide winners and losers, week after week, in primaries and caucuses. Clinton may hold a lead in pledged delegates, but that isn’t likely to intimidate Sanders after what happened in Michigan. At a debate hosted by The Washington Post and Univision in Miami, a Guatemalan woman whose husband was deported asked candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton what they would do reunite families. Lucia Quiej brought her five children, who haven't seen their father in three years, to the debate. (The Washington Post) Clinton should be familiar with what awaits her in the weeks ahead. She went through this in 2008 against then-Sen. Barack Obama, but from the other side, playing the role that Sanders plays today: the dogged challenger hanging in against long odds. Eight years ago, Obama was on the brink of ending the race for the nomination, having won 11 consecutive victories in February after Super Tuesday. One last obstacle remained: contests in Ohio and Texas in early March. Then, Bill Clinton set his wife’s expectations almost impossibly high. He suggested that a loss in either state would knock her out of the race. The Obama team poured more than 15 million into those contests, determined to bring the race to a close. Instead, Clinton began to find her voice — with a more populist economic message. Sound familiar? She went on to win Ohio and a popular-vote victory in the Texas primary. A dejected Obama knew instantly what the results meant. Though he had a lead in delegates that would be difficult to surmount, he realized the race would grind on interminably for three more months. That’s the possible impact of what happened in Michigan on Tuesday. A Clinton victory could have effectively ended Sanders’s rationale for continuing, though it was doubtful he would have gotten out of the race soon. Now, though he trails in pledged delegates by a substantial margin, he has been revived, just as Clinton was eight years ago this month. This cannot be a happy moment for Clinton this week as she assesses the cost of her Michigan loss. Sanders had been told just before Tuesday’s vote that he probably would lose narrowly. Clinton’s campaign knew it was possible, though not necessarily likely, that she could lose Michigan. The demographics played better to Sanders than other recent states. Ironically it was her ability to win white, working-class Democrats against Obama that kept her 2008 campaign going. Against Sanders on Tuesday, she lost not only whites without college degrees but also whites with college degrees. Much of this goes to the issue of the continuing weakness in her candidacy, the issues of trust and authenticity. Asked a direct question about this in the debate, Clinton said, “I do take responsibility.” She followed that by saying, “I am not a natural politician, in case you haven’t noticed, unlike my husband and President Obama . . . I have to do the best I can.” After a year of campaigning, Clinton still seems not to have found a comfortable voice or a message that comes from her heart, unlike eight years ago as she battled to overtake Obama. This came to the fore in Michigan, a trade-sensitive state, where she struggled to demonstrate that she is as resistant to trade agreements as her opponent. Her attack on Sanders in last Sunday’s debate as an opponent of the auto bailout was a stretch at best, a deliberate distortion at worst. On Tuesday she doubled down on the issue, seeking to show that Sanders had opposed a bill early in 2009 that included funds to save the industry. But almost immediately after she did, David Axelrod, who was senior adviser to Obama in the White House, tweeted this: “She did it again and I’ll say it again. It’s misleading to imply that TARP II was an auto bailout bill.” The tactic was reminiscent of the campaign’s earlier claim that Sanders wanted to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and leave millions of people without health insurance — an argument that, no matter how one feels about his support for a single-payer type system, did not ring true. Sanders’s message has defined the contest and she has had to respond to it, just as she has had to adapt to a changing Democratic Party. Clinton’s clear advantage today is the same one Obama enjoyed in 2008 after he lost Ohio and Texas. Thanks to Democratic rules of proportionality, Sanders probably will struggle to make up his deficit in delegates. That hill is even higher when Clinton’s support from elected officials and party leaders — the superdelegates — is included. Next week will bring contests in Florida, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina. Florida and North Carolina look good for Clinton; the other three present opportunities for Sanders, though none will be easy for him. By next week at this time, if she runs the table or comes close, the conversation might have shifted again, to the reality of the delegate math. That, however, will not deter Sanders. He sees the calendar farther ahead as increasingly favorable. He has the money and now the incentive to stay in until the end and already is eyeing big efforts in big states such as New York and California. His advisers believe he can win a series of states later in March and beyond, even if he makes much less progress in cutting down Clinton’s advantage in delegates. Whatever transpires from here, this is not the campaign Clinton envisioned. She remains the favorite to win the nomination. Michigan did not change that. But because of that vote, she faces renewed doubts about her effectiveness as a candidate. They are many of the same ones she has been dealing with since the campaign began long ago. ||||| The Democratic race is a tangle of contradiction, paradox and pungent little ironies. Take Hillary Clinton. Here’s a prohibitive front-runner with an allegedly bottomless reservoir of Wall Street cash who is being outspent by a guy who once professed his admiration for Fidel Castro. Story Continued Below Bernie Sanders, he of the orgiastic 10,000 college-kid rally, has collected a million-plus fewer votes than the ostensibly yawn-inducing Clinton. Sanders is a creature of momentum and hope whose path to the nomination is getting narrower all the time, and at Wednesday’s debate, Mr. Anti-Establishment more or less conceded he can’t win without wooing establishmentarian superdelegates. Their latest collision — at the Univision/CNN debate in Miami on Wednesday — was suitably feisty and characteristically inconclusive. Clinton — disciplined, in denial, or a little bit of both — pretended that her back-breaking Michigan loss never happened — and Sanders made it out to be the most resounding upset since Truman beat Dewey. “I won one of the contests and lost another close one,” said Clinton, speaking of her big win in Mississippi. “I was pleased I got 100,000 more votes last night than my opponent and more delegates.” Sanders said Michigan was momentous, as “one of the greatest political upsets in history.” Nobody won, nobody lost, and everybody's hunkering down for a marathon that will last at least until April. Here are five takeaways. 1. Slick Bernie. It’s time to look past the sartorial sloth to see the political steel in Bernard (no middle name) Sanders. There is no more disciplined candidate in the 2016 field than the 74-year-old Vermont senator — none — and a quick scan of the transcripts of recent debates reveals his metronomic recitation of succinct anti-Clinton attack phrases repeated over and over and over with deadly, aw-shucks efficiency. No. One on the list is his call for her to release transcripts of her paid Wall Street speeches. This is his March 6 version, which was virtually identical to his Wednesday night spiel: “Secretary Clinton wanted everyone else to release it. Well, I’m your Democratic opponent, I release it. Here it is. There ain’t nothing! I don’t give speeches to Wall Street for hundreds of thousands of dollars. You got it.” Sanders’ message discipline allows him to engage in politically expedient character attacks that are the staple of standard-issue negative campaigning — while portraying himself as a class warrior impelled only by principle. Paradoxically, Sanders’ biggest “mistake” of the campaign — saying the American people don’t “give a damn” about Clinton’s email server — has turned out to be one of his canniest moves: The fact that he turned down a free shot at the first debate has given him a permission structure to subsequently hammer her relentlessly. Oh, and the server issue gets mentioned plenty without his help: On Wednesday night, moderator Jorge Ramos asked Clinton whether she’d drop out if she gets indicted. 2. Scattershot Hillary. The New York Times editorial board thinks Hillary Clinton is being a big meanie to Bernie Sanders, and that’s why she lost Michigan. “Even with a double-digit lead before the primary, she failed to avoid the type of negative tactics that could damage her in the long haul,” the board wrote. “If she hopes to unify Democrats as the nominee, trying to tarnish Mr. Sanders as she did in Michigan this week is not the way to go. Mrs. Clinton’s falsely parsing Mr. Sanders’s Senate vote on a 2008 recession-related bailout bill as abandoning the auto industry rescue hurt her credibility.” Her camp says the charge is perfectly fair because Sanders voted against the only bailout bill that had a chance. Whatever. Every political professional knows that Clinton must attack Sanders to win, to defend herself against his (indirect) characterization of her as a bought-and-sold establishment hack. And no editorial board has asked him to cease his attacks on her for the sake of greater party comity and human dignity. That said, Clinton’s recent onslaught against Sanders has an unfocused, over-the-top quality that doesn’t paint a coherent negative portrait of the man standing across the stage. It’s not a problem of excessive nastiness, it’s a question of passing the oppo-dump sniff test. The Bernie Sanders whom Clinton described on Wednesday night is a guy who once supported the Minutemen anti-immigrant movement, is a tool of the Koch brothers, a reactionary in Fidel Castro khakis who is happily helping Republicans dismantle Obamacare. He’s none of those things, actually. There is a potentially effective and focused attack on Sanders obscured in the thicket of Clinton exaggeration: Sanders, the argument goes, is just too pure to actually govern, and he prefers casting a perfect “no” to crafting an imperfect-but-valuable compromise. As one Clinton adviser recently put it to me: “She’s easy to attack because she’s done so much. … You can’t attack Bernie ‘cause he hasn’t done a goddamned thing.” It’s not the sexiest message — the “progressive who can get things done” argument she makes at the start of every debate — but it’s the one that most fits her candidacy and most authentically exposes Sanders’ weaknesses. 3. Clinton’s best line of the campaign. Self-deprecation is not Clinton’s default — she’s simply too proud a person — but she’s recently been adding a powerful (if painfully obvious) admission to her speeches and interviews. “I am not a natural politician, in case you haven’t noticed, like my husband or President Obama.” Or Bernie Sanders. 4. Sanders fought Clinton to a draw on immigration. So far, Clinton has enjoyed a small but significant advantage among Hispanic voters (despite a disputed entrance poll that showed him winning Latinos in Nevada), echoing her strong showing with Latinos in 2008. But Sanders isn’t conceding anything this time, despite polls showing him trailing badly in Florida. He challenged her record on immigration Wednesday, mocking her slow disavowal of an Obama administration policy that has resulted in the deportation of hundreds of Central American children. And she returned fire, accusing him of supporting legislation as a House member a decade ago that led to mass deportations, a bill she claimed was backed by Minutemen vigilante groups in Arizona. It got under Sanders’ skin: \\"No, I do not support vigilantes, and that is a horrific statement and an unfair statement to make,” he said, adding: “I will match my record against yours any day of the week.” 5. Jorge Ramos cares very much about Clinton’s damn emails. Say what you want about Univision’s most famous newsman — who was infamously carried bodily from a Trump news conference for speaking out of turn — he’s an equal opportunity pest. To the dismay of the groaning, booing audience in Miami, Ramos twice pressed Clinton on the fallout from her use of a private email server as secretary of state. The first time, he asked Clintonwhether she had imposed a double standard on her Foggy Bottom employees, demanding they use government servers while she switched over to a “homebrew” setup. She parried that one easily, rolling out her usual retort that her actions were identical to those of her predecessors, including Colin Powell. A few minutes later, Ramos returned to the subject with a vengeance. \\"If you get indicted, will you drop out?” he asked her, craning forward as if to dodge the cascade of disapproval welling up behind him in the crowd. Clinton guffawed, then smiled. “Oh, for goodness — that is not going to happen. I’m not even answering that question.” ||||| The day after Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersRussian government promotes conspiracy surrounding murdered DNC staffer Bernie backers fight to take over California Democrats Charter school industry scores huge victory in Los Angeles MORE squeaked by Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonBaldwin's Trump sings 'Hallelujah' with WH advisers for SNL season finale Dem rips Trump's claim of historically unfair treatment The Memo: Trump base shows signs of cracking MORE in the Michigan primaries, the two Democratic presidential candidates engaged in a contentious debate as they ready for big-delegate states next week. ADVERTISEMENT And while Wednesday night’s Univision debate came just three days after the last one, it had its share of pivotal moments. Univision broadcast the debate from Miami in Spanish, simulcast and translated on CNN, with moderators asking some of the race’s most pointed questions on immigration and other hot button issues. With just days until the all-important March 15 primaries, where more than 30 percent of delegates will be awarded, including in Florida, here are five things to know about Wednesday’s debate. The Democratic Party has moved to the left on immigration A healthy dose of immigration policy was expected during Wednesday's debate. But the candidates' posture — their agreements and their attacks against each other — showed a party that's ready to shift even further to the left than its current standard-bearer, President Obama. Both candidates agreed to not deport any person in the U.S. illegally who has not committed any other crimes; they doubled down on pushing Obama's immigration executive actions even further and they pledged to tackle immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship as a top priority. But Clinton hung Sanders's 2007 vote against immigration reform around his neck, casting his argument that he voted against the bill because of concerns about inhumane guest-worker policies as fiction. \\"I think it’s very hard to make the case that Ted Kennedy, Barack Obama Barack ObamaMcMaster suggests Trump won’t say ‘radical Islamic terrorism’ in speech Trump gets royal welcome during 'tremendous' Saudi Arabia visit Why is Trump rewarding Saudi war crimes with more weapons? MORE, me, La Raza, United Farm Workers, Dolores Huerta, leaders of the Hispanic community would have supported a bill that actually promoted modern slavery,” Clinton said. Sanders struck back by arguing that Clinton had been too conservative in coming out against driver's licenses for those in America illegally back in 2007 and that she wasn't compassionate enough when child migrants fled to America in 2014. \\"One of the great human tragedies of recent years was when children came from Honduras, where there is probably more violence than almost every place in this country,\\" Sanders said. \\"And I said welcome those children into this country. Secretary Clinton said send them back.” The emphasis comes as Donald Trump Donald TrumpTom Perez: 'Donald Trump has to go' Trump's 2018 budget would slash EPA spending by 30 percent: report Are American airports really ‘third-world’ in quality? MORE continues to strengthen his grip on the Republican nomination, a reality that could drive even more Hispanics to vote for the Democrats. Clinton and Sanders are getting under each other's skin The Democratic debates may lack the off-color and personal barbs seen on the GOP side of the aisle, but it's becoming clear that the two Democrats are starting to get exasperated with one another. Sunday's debate marked the most contentious one yet, and that flavor carried over into Wednesday night, with Clinton sternly rebuking Sanders with an \\"excuse me\\" when he tried to interrupt her. Sanders made a similar remark on Sunday, which resulted in boos from that debate's audience. One flashpoint came when Clinton repeated her recent accusation that Sanders had been against the auto bailout. The Vermont senator accused her of cherrypicking pieces of his record, noting that he had supported an auto bailout but only voted against the bill because it bailed out Wall Street as well. \\"What the secretary is doing tonight, and has done very often, is take large pieces of legislation and take pieces out of it,\\" Sanders said, bashing her for making \\"unfair\\" and \\"horrific\\" statements. \\"I will match my record against yours any day.\\" Sanders has eyes on the superdelegates Clinton leads in pledged delegates — those won by election — by 206. But with superdelegates — those who are free to support whomever they want and can change their minds at any time — Clinton’s lead rises. Clinton has more than 460 superdelegates to Sanders' approximately 20, which, when added to her pledged delegates, has put her more than halfway to the total needed to win the nomination. That makes it a tough hill for Sanders to climb — unless he can capture some of those superdelegates, party leaders who have overwhelmingly backed Clinton. Aware of that reality, Sanders publicly pivoted to an appeal to the party's superdelegates. Lauding his upset win in Michigan by noting that some have called the win one of the \\"major political upsets in modern American history,\\" Sanders pitched an optimistic message. \\"We will continue to do extremely well, win a number of these primaries and convince superdelegates that Bernie Sanders is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump.\\" Clinton is done with the email questions Clinton faced some of her toughest questions during Wednesday's debate on the investigation into her use of a private email server while secretary of State, and her answers showed she is ready to move past it. \\"I'm not concerned about it. I'm not worried about it, and no Democrat or American should be, either,\\" she said. When pressed by moderator Jorge Ramos about whether she'd drop out if she was indicted on the matter, Clinton refused to answer. \\"Oh, for goodness, it's not going to happen. I'm not even answering that question,\\" she said. The answer comes a week after a State Department staffer took an immunity deal surrounding the FBI investigation into her emails. Clinton said Sunday that she's happy to hear that the employee is cooperating. Sanders won’t back down on Clinton’s paid speeches Sanders believes that he’s found a weak spot for Clinton: her paid speeches to Wall Street. He has repeatedly called on her to release the transcripts of them, questioning whether she had been cozying up to Wall Street in private. “I would think that a speech so great that you got paid so much money for, you would like to share it with the American people,” Sanders said. When Clinton said that she had gone to the banks ahead of the financial crisis to warn them about reckless behavior, Sanders shot back sarcastically. \\"Clearly the secretary's words to Wall Street has really intimidated [Wall Street], and that is why they have given her 15 million in campaign contributions,\\" he joked. In response, Clinton evoked a recent ad from a group aligned with the Koch Brothers that praised his stance against the Export-Import Bank. The reminder is a particularly harsh one for Sanders, who repeatedly rails on the Koch's influence in politics. ||||| It was only three days since the last Democratic debate, but Wednesday night's showdown in Miami might as well have been a whole new race. Since debating in Flint on Sunday night, Bernie Sanders had scored an upset victory in Michigan — a surprise win that's put Hillary Clinton on the defensive while emboldening Sanders. Clinton, addressing the results directly, noted that she won more votes and more delegates on Tuesday (thanks to her big win in Mississippi) even as she and Sanders split the states. It was a confident and accurate portrayal of the state of the race. But her words and actions on the debate stage betrayed a much more profound insecurity. While Sunday night she seemed confident in a message that she was sure — based on extensive polling — would deliver a clear Michigan victory on March 8, followed by clear Illinois and Ohio victories on March 15, by Wednesday night she seemed profoundly uncertain of where she stood. Technical glitches and a shaky command of debate management from a television crew that hasn't been involved in earlier debates this cycle further added to the unsettled atmosphere, as did a rowdy and vocal crowd. The overall effect was a debate that was not itself a transformative moment in the campaign so much as a signifier of how the campaign has been transformed once again. Clinton still holds a very solid lead, and all signs point to her winning. But nobody — including Clinton herself — is certain of how solid those signs are, and for now she's watching her back quite nervously. Here are a few people who benefited and suffered from the fog. Winner: Bernie Sanders In part, Sanders simply benefited from good fortune. All three of the moderators were more focused on Clinton's weaknesses than Sanders's, and set the tone for a debate that overwhelmingly put Clinton on the defensive. The only really tough question Sanders got came very late in the debate and on an issue — his past praise of Fidel Castro and Daniel Ortega — that Democratic primary voters probably don't care about. Still, despite a favorable landscape, Sanders executed cleanly, crisply, and clearly. He delivered multiple red meat lines that attracted thunderous applause from the audience. Perhaps most of all, Sanders effectively pulled off the central rhetorical trick of his campaign: repeatedly making policy commitments that are well to the left of the Obama administration while downplaying the idea of a sharp break between himself and the popular incumbent president. In Clinton's best debates, she wields President Obama as an effective human shield, forcing Sanders to tone down his fiery condemnations of Washington corruption and throwing him off his message. Wednesday night, he didn't have that problem. He slammed Clinton on her speaking fees, where she can't use Obama as a shield, and deftly made a calculated break with Obama on deportations. Winner: Republicans Two days ago, I expected Hillary Clinton to win Michigan handily and then take advantage of the Univision debate to begin pivoting to the center and focusing the bulk of her energy on attacking the GOP field. Tonight should have been an opportunity to pin Donald Trump down to his extreme views, to elevate the national profile of some of Ted Cruz's more hard-right positions, and to start questioning the image of John Kasich as a moderate. Instead, Clinton narrowly lost Michigan and found herself bogged down in a real dogfight of a debate. Both candidates directed the vast majority of their fire at each other, generating a somewhat exaggerated view of the differences between them and forgoing an opportunity to drive home an anti-Republican message. And the back and forth between Clinton and Sanders largely consisted of a relentless leftward march on every issue under the sun. Voters alarmed by the state of the Republican field but concerned that Democrats would indulge in overtaxation and be too relaxed about government spending, too soft on crime or too weak on national security, heard absolutely nothing reassuring Wednesday night. Sanders drove home his left-wing message, and Clinton generally found herself tapping gingerly to the left rather than standing her ground. Loser: Hillary Clinton From the first day of the 2016 campaign right through to today, Clinton has been the favorite to win the nomination. She has had her stumbles and Sanders has had his victories, but she remains the frontrunner, and that hasn't changed. But one of her core objectives throughout this primary has been not just to win, but to win without letting herself get dragged into left-wing positions that will complicate her task in the general election. Until tonight, she'd done a pretty good job of it. But when hit by waves of questions that were less about comprehensive immigration reform than about enforcement of existing immigration law, she made a series of commitments that go well beyond the existing Democratic Party consensus. Clinton indicated that she wouldn't deport children, and maybe wouldn't deport anyone at all as long as they haven't violated non-immigration laws. She even went so far as to suggest she will try to help people who've already been deported come back to the United States. The narrow political calculation here is clear enough — Clinton needs nonwhite voters to win the primary, and most general election voters probably don't care too much about this. But the net effect is to dull the sense that Donald Trump has an extreme position on immigration by countering \\"deport everyone\\" with \\"deport almost nobody.\\" Video: The audience booed for eight straight seconds when Hillary Clinton was asked about Benghazi Loser: Univision This debate was a mess, starting with the fact that Sanders's microphone didn't work at the beginning through to disastrous audio mixing on the simultaneous translation that often left neither the Spanish nor English audible. But the problems went well beyond technical issues. The moderators opened the debate with two process questions in a row, and repeatedly went back to the well of faux hardball questions rather than illuminating ones. Not all the questions were bad, though, and the debate featured many intriguing exchanges. Yet each time an argument was getting good, the moderators would butt in to declare that time was up and we needed to move on to a different subject. Given the one-on-one nature of the debate, there was simply no need for this. Disagreements between Clinton and Sanders over the wisdom of single-payer health care, over the merits of the 2007 immigration reform bill, over the Export-Import Bank, and a half-dozen other issues ended up being cut short in favor of pivots to often-useless questions about email servers or Benghazi. The result was, on most issues, something more like a side-by-side display of talking points than a real debate. Loser: Voters who care about immigration Immigration policy hasn't been central to the 2016 Democratic campaign, and a debate co-hosted by Univision was a perfect opportunity to dive deeper into the topic and get a clearer view of where the candidates stand. As you might expect, we got quite a few questions on immigration. But those questions produced surprisingly little actual clarity on the policy issues or the choices facing the candidates. Clinton and Sanders, for example, rehearsed a now-familiar dialogue in which she slams him for having opposed the bipartisan 2007 immigration reform bill, after which Sanders explains he opposed it because it expanded guest worker programs that he regards as \\"akin to slavery.\\" Does that mean Sanders wants to eliminate these programs? Given that the US has several different classes of guest-worker visas, which ones specifically does he have a problem with? Does Clinton agree with his criticisms of them, even if they reached different conclusions about the merits of the 2007 law? Do the candidates think the current level of immigration to the United States is appropriate? Too high? Too low? What do they make of the rising anti-immigration sentiment in the Republican Party, and how does that change their thinking about the path forward for legislation? These weedsier questions about immigration are unlikely to be aired in any other forum, and it would have been great to take the time to delve into them rather than spending so much time rehashing questions that have been debated time and again.

By making sure to take the meat out of the freezer well ahead of time, Sasha demonstrates a level of thoughtfulness and planning that is characteristic of someone who is well-organized. Being organized means that Sasha is able to effectively coordinate and manage tasks, resources, and time in an orderly manner. Furthermore, Sasha's proactive behavior demonstrates efficiency as well. Efficiency is all about achieving a goal or completing a task with the least amount of resources required. In this case, Sasha's early action of taking out the meat from the freezer ensures that it will be properly thawed and ready to be cooked when needed, thereby avoiding any delays or last-minute stress that may arise from not having the necessary ingredients prepared beforehand. Taking into account both organization and efficiency, it is evident that Sasha's actions showcase a person who is attentive to details, follows a well-structured approach, and aims to accomplish tasks in the most effective way possible. This allows Sasha to stay on top of things and maintain a sense of control over various responsibilities, ultimately leading to increased productivity and success both in everyday tasks and more complex endeavors.

This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time.

To do that, we'll add 69119 to both sides: -22863 + 69119 = -2891 * f Now let's find the sum: 46256 = -2891 * f Now, we need to find out what f is. To do that, we'll divide by -2891 on both sides: 46256 / -2891 = f Finally, let's find the answer: f = -16 So there you have it! The answer to the math problem is f = -16."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: When international aid is given, steps must be taken to ensure that the aid reaches the people for whom it is intended.

Perhaps the UNO could set up a body of devoted men and women in every country who can speedily distribute aid to victims of floods and earthquakes. More than the help that one nation can give to another during a disaster; it would be more effective to give other forms of help during normal times. A common proverb says, \\" _ \\" If we follow this wise saying, it would be right to teach people from less developed nations to take care of themselves. For example, a country could share its technology with another. This could be in simple areas like agriculture or in more complex areas like medical and health care or even in building satellites. Even small country is able to help less developed nations. Sometimes what is take for granted, like the setting up of a water purification plant or the administration of a school, could be useful for countries which are looking about to solve common problems. It does not cost much to share such simple things. Exchange students could be attached for a number of months or years and learn the required craft while on the site. They can then take their knowledge back to their homelands and if necessary come back form time to time to clear doubts or to update themselves. Such aid will be truly helpful and there is no chance of it being temporary or of it falling into the wrong hands. Many countries run extensive courses in all sorts of skills.

Odissi (Odia: odd'ishii Odisi), also referred to as Orissi in older literature, is a major ancient Indian classical dance that originated in the Hindu temples of Odisha - an eastern coastal state of India. Odissi, in its history, was performed predominantly by women, and expressed religious stories and spiritual ideas, particularly of Vaishnavism (Vishnu as Jagannath). Odissi performances have also expressed ideas of other traditions such as those related to Hindu gods Shiva and Surya, as well as Hindu goddesses (Shaktism). The theoretical foundations of Odissi trace to the ancient Sanskrit text Natya Shastra, its existence in antiquity evidenced by the dance poses in the sculptures of Odissi Hindu temples, and archeological sites related to Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The Buddhist, Jain and Hindu archaeological sites in Odisha state, particularly the Assia range of hills show inscriptions and carvings of dances that are dated to the 6th to 9th century CE. Important sites include the Ranigumpha in Udaygiri, and various caves and temples at Lalitgiri, Ratnagiri and Alatgiri sites. The Buddhist icons, for example, are depicted as dancing gods and goddesses, with Haruka, Vajravarahi, and Marichi in Odissi-like postures. Historical evidence, states Alexandra Carter, shows that Odissi Maharis (Hindu temple dancers) and dance halls architecture (nata-mandap) were in vogue at least by the 9th century CE. According to Kapila Vatsyayan, the Kalpasutra of Jainism, in its manuscripts discovered in Gujarat, includes classical Indian dance poses - such as the Samapada, the Tribhangi and the Chuaka of Odissi. This, states Vatsyayan, suggests that Odissi was admired or at least well known in distant parts of India, far from Odisha in the medieval era, to be included in the margins of an important Jain text. However, the Jain manuscripts use the dance poses as decorative art in the margins and cover, but do not describe or discuss the dance. Hindu dance texts such as the Abhinaya Chandrika and Abhinaya Darpana provide a detailed description of the movements of the feet, hands, the standing postures, the movement and the dance repertoire. It includes illustrations of the Karanas mentioned in NatyaShastra. Similarly, the illustrated Hindu text on temple architecture from Odisha, the Shilpaprakasha, deals with Odia architecture and sculpture, and includes Odissi postures. Actual sculptures that have survived into the modern era and panel reliefs in Odia temples, dated to be from the 10th to 14th century, show Odissi dance. This is evidenced in Jagannath temple in Puri, as well as other temples of Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism and Vedic deities such as Surya (Sun) in Odisha. There are several sculptures of dancers and musicians in Konark Sun Temple and Brahmeswara Temple in Bhubaneswar. The composition of the poetic texts by 8th century Shankaracharya and particularly of divine love inspired Gitagovinda by 12th century Jayadeva influenced the focus and growth of modern Odissi. Odissi was performed in the temples by the dancers called Maharis, who played out these spiritual poems and underlying religious plays, after training and perfecting their art of dance starting from an early age, and who were revered as auspicious to religious services.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: In what arenas were you able to witness the Odissi performers in the Medieval era?","completion":"In the Medieval era, Odissi performers could be witnessed in religious temples, as mentioned in the text: \\"Odissi was performed in the temples by the dancers called Maharis, who played out these spiritual poems and underlying religious plays, after training and perfecting their art of dance starting from an early age, and who were revered as auspicious to religious services.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The couple gave their two children nicknames, with Mortimer being \\"Boberic\\" and Amy being \\"Totsy\\". When Wheeler was four, his father was appointed chief leader writer for the Bradford Observer. The family relocated to Saltaire, a village northwest of Bradford, a cosmopolitan city in Yorkshire, northeast England, which was then in the midst of the wool trade boom.

A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God. Hot day, no air conditioning on the bus, people just want to get to their destinations. Question: Who was angry as the bus rode on?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Rudolf Joseph Lorenz Steiner (27 (or 25) February 1861 - 30 March 1925) was an Austrian philosopher, social reformer, architect and esotericist. Steiner gained initial recognition at the end of the nineteenth century as a literary critic and published philosophical works including The Philosophy of Freedom. At the beginning of the twentieth century he founded an esoteric spiritual movement, anthroposophy, with roots in German idealist philosophy and theosophy; other influences include Goethean science and Rosicrucianism. In the first, more philosophically oriented phase of this movement, Steiner attempted to find a synthesis between science and spirituality. The Anthroposophical Society grew rapidly. Fueled by a need to find an artistic home for their yearly conferences, which included performances of plays written by Edouard Schure and Steiner, the decision was made to build a theater and organizational center. In 1913, construction began on the first Goetheanum building, in Dornach, Switzerland. The building, designed by Steiner, was built to a significant part by volunteers who offered craftsmanship or simply a will to learn new skills. Once World War I started in 1914, the Goetheanum volunteers could hear the sound of cannon fire beyond the Swiss border, but despite the war, people from all over Europe worked peaceably side by side on the building's construction. Steiner's lecture activity expanded enormously with the end of the war. Most importantly, from 1919 on Steiner began to work with other members of the society to found numerous practical institutions and activities, including the first Waldorf school, founded that year in Stuttgart, Germany. At the same time, the Goetheanum developed as a wide-ranging cultural centre. On New Year's Eve, 1922/1923, the building burned to the ground; contemporary police reports indicate arson as the probable cause. Steiner immediately began work designing a second Goetheanum building - this time made of concrete instead of wood - which was completed in 1928, three years after his death. At a \\"Foundation Meeting\\" for members held at the Dornach center during Christmas, 1923, Steiner spoke of laying a new Foundation Stone for the society in the hearts of his listeners. At the meeting, a new \\"General Anthroposophical Society\\" was established with a new executive board. At this meeting, Steiner also founded a School of Spiritual Science, intended as an \\"organ of initiative\\" for research and study and as \\"the 'soul' of the Anthroposophical Society\\". This School, which was led by Steiner, initially had sections for general anthroposophy, education, medicine, performing arts (eurythmy, speech, drama and music), the literary arts and humanities, mathematics, astronomy, science, and visual arts. Later sections were added for the social sciences, youth and agriculture. The School of Spiritual Science included meditative exercises given by Steiner. When was the second one completed?","completion":"The second building, which was also known as the second Goetheanum, was completed in 1928.

Robert Lee \\"Bullet Bob\\" Hayes (December 20, 1942 - September 18, 2002) was an Olympic sprinter turned American football wide receiver in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys. An American track and field athlete, he was a two-sport stand-out in college in both track and football at Florida A&M University. He has one of the top 100 meter times by NFL players. Hayes was enshrined in the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor in 2001 and was selected for induction in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in January 2009. At the 1964 Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, Hayes had his finest hour as a sprinter. First, he won the 100m and in doing so tied the then world record in the 100 m with a time of 10.06 seconds, even though he was running in lane 1 which had, the day before, been used for the 20 km racewalk and this badly chewed up the cinder track. He also was running in borrowed spikes because one of his shoes had been kicked under the bed when he was playing with some friends and he didn't realize until he got there. This was followed by a second gold medal in the 4x100 meter relay, which also produced a new World Record (39.06 seconds). His come-from-behind win for the US team in the relay was one of the most memorable Olympic moments. Hand-timed between 8.5 and 8.9 seconds, his relay leg is the fastest in history. Jocelyn Delecour, France's anchor leg runner, famously said to Paul Drayton before the relay final that, \\"You can't win, all you have is Bob Hayes.\\" Drayton was able to reply afterwards, \\"That's all we need.\\" The race was also Hayes' last as a track and field athlete, as he permanently switched to football after it, aged only 21. In some of the first meets to be timed with experimental fully automatic timing, Hayes was the first man to break ten seconds for the 100 meters, albeit with a 5.3 m/s wind assistance in the semi-finals of the 1964 Olympics. His time was recorded at 9.91 seconds. Jim Hines officially broke 10 seconds at the high altitude of Mexico City, Mexico in 1968 (and on a synthetic track) with a wind legal 9.95 which stood as the world record for almost 15 years. The next to surpass Hayes at a low altitude Olympics was Carl Lewis in 1984 when he won in 9.99, some 20 years later (though Hasely Crawford equaled the time in 1976). Until the Tokyo Olympics, world records were measured by officials with stopwatches, measured to the nearest tenth of a second. Although fully automatic timing was used in Tokyo, the times were given the appearance of manual timing. This was done by subtracting 0.05 seconds from the automatic time and rounding to the nearest tenth of a second, making Hayes' time of 10.06 seconds convert to 10.0 seconds, despite the fact that the officials with stopwatches had measured Hayes' time to be 9.9 seconds, and the average difference between manual and automatic times was typically 0.15 to 0.20 seconds. This unique method of determining the official time therefore denied Hayes the record of being the first to officially record 9.9 seconds for the 100 meters. The first official times of 9.9 seconds were recorded at the \\"Night of Speed\\" in 1968. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"Of course, little buddy! There are a lot of cool things about Bob Hayes mentioned in the article. This guy was super fast, like a superhero. One of the amazing parts was when he won two gold medals at the Olympics in 1964.

He ran so fast that he tied the world record at that time! He also ran the fastest relay leg ever, which is like if your team is far behind in a race, but then you come in and run so fast that you still win. It's like in a cartoon when the roadrunner speeds away from the coyote. That was amazing! But the funny and surprising part is that he won that 100m race even though he was wearing someone else's shoes, because he lost his own. Just imagine, little buddy, how fast he could have been with his own shoes! Then he left the running scene and joined football, where he also became a star.

It can be hard to maintain the same work hours every day when you work from home, but maintaining regular work hours can help you to keep your work and home life separate. Choose realistic work hours and stick to them. For example, you might decide to work from 8:00am to 4:30pm on Monday through Friday. Don’t let your work hours creep into your personal time. When it is time to stop for the day, stop working, shut down your laptop, and step away from your work space. Try to set work hours that work with your personal life. For example, try to avoid working on the weekends if you know that there are things you will want to do. Change into work clothes in the morning and non-work clothes in the evening. Rolling out of bed and going straight to your workspace in your pajamas will make it harder for you to transition into your workday. The same thing goes for wearing your work clothes into the evening. Try getting up about 30 to 60 minutes before you want to start working for the day so that you can get dressed for work. Make sure that you change out of your work clothes when it is time to relax. For example, you can switch to pajamas or your favorite jeans and a t-shirt. When you work at an office, taking a lunch break is necessary and you may even have someone else reminding you to take one. However, when you work from home, it can be hard to remember to take lunch breaks and you may be tempted to work through your lunch or eat at your workspace. Instead, make lunch breaks a mandatory part of your day. Set a time for your lunch break to start and end every day. For example, you might agree to take lunch from 12:00 to 12:30 each day. Ask a family member or significant other to remind you when it is time for your lunch break. If you are worried about forgetting to take a lunch break, then ask one of your friends or family members to come get you when it is time for a break. You may be tempted to do things around your house while you are taking a quick break or making a work phone call, but this can blur the dividing line between work and home. Try to prevent yourself from doing any housework or anything that is not work related while you are on the clock. If you notice a household chore that you want to complete, write it down on a notepad and save it for the end of your work day. Keep in mind that everyone is different. For example, if you find that folding laundry is a soothing way for you to spend a break, then go for it! Finding a simple way to reward yourself for a hard day of work is also important. You can reward yourself with a walk outside, a cup of tea, a chat with a friend, or any other pleasant activity that indicates your work day is over. Consider doing something social at the end of each day. Working from home can be isolating, so it is important for you to find ways to interact with other people. You can do this by talking to your significant other, meeting up with some friends for coffee, or taking an aerobics class after work.","completion":"Maintaining regular work hours while working from home can help separate professional and personal life by setting realistic work schedules, changing into and out of work clothes, taking mandatory lunch breaks, avoiding house chores during work hours, and socializing after work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Barely 36 hours after agreeing the punitive bailout deal with fellow eurozone leaders, the Greek PM has given a solid defense of the agreement he brought back from Brussels. He was scathing about the tactics played by his opponents, declaring: “Last night was a bad night for Europe.” and adding that the events last weekend “does not honour the tradition of a democratic Europe”. He repeated his claim that, by calling a referendum, he had ended up with a better deal that addresses Greece’s medium-term funding needs. And, eventually, debt relief. “To be frank, here, they [eurozone countries] are not only forced to give fresh money, but to give 82 billion, and are accepting the restructure of debt.” However, there was no pretense that he’d played a blinder in Brussels. Tsipras even admitted that he didn’t believe in the plan forced on Greece - but he’d do his best to implement it. “I am fully assuming my responsibilities, for mistakes and for oversights, and for the responsibility of signing a text that I do not believe in, but that I am obliged to implement,” There were signs that Tsipras was still digesting the impact of his all-night battles with his eurozone neighbours, as he said bitterly that: “The hard truth is this one-way street for Greece was imposed on us,” That #Tsipras spoke of #Greece suffering post-traumatic stress at moment says all you need to know about what kind of w/e he had #Greece On Grexit, he warned that the risk hadn’t totally vanished, until the bailout deal has been ratified. But he was adamant that the country didn’t have the resources to cope outside the eurozone. And he claimed that some conservative groups would be keen to see Syriza out on their collective ear. The bruises from the Euro summit may never really heal. He didn’t dump the blame for the crisis on Yanis Varoufakis -- his former finance minister was a great economist; that doesn’t always translate into political skills, though. But perhaps most importantly, Tsipras vowed to fight on and take hard decisions. “The worst thing a captain could do while he is steering a ship during a storm, as difficult as it is, would be to abandon the helm.” We’ll find out on Wednesday night whether Cap’n Alexis has the support of the crew, when Syriza are asked to vote on the tough austerity and radical economic reforms demanded by creditors. But tonight, he’s got his hand on the rudder. So, hats off to @tsipras_eu at last? #Tsipras overarching theme: #Greece backed into corner. Doesn't believe in agreement. Bad night for Europe.

Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"The answer to your question \\"Which one is part of genome, mRNAs or genes?\\" is genes. The genome of an organism is the complete set of DNA, including all of its genes. Genes carry information to make proteins. Each DNA sequence that constitutes a gene tells the cell how to construct a protein. This information is then transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules by the process of transcription for protein synthesis in a process known as translation. The paragraph you're referring to discusses the development of understanding in genetics. Initially, it was thought that one gene makes one protein. However, this has been further understood that one gene can make multiple proteins due to a process called alternative splicing. Additionally, there are coding sequences scattered in short sections across the genome, and their mRNAs are concatenated by trans-splicing. However, whether considering the initial model or the expanded understanding of gene function, in both cases, it is genes that are considered a part of the genome, not mRNAs. mRNAs are products of genes in action, carrying the genetic code for proteins from the DNA in the nucleus to the ribosomes where proteins are synthesized, but they are not part of the genome itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: 1). no 2). yes...I think the answer is","completion":"2). Yes, both sentences essentially convey the same meaning, although they use slightly different phrasing and wording. I will provide a detailed comparison for both sentences which will demonstrate their similarities and how the information is being conveyed. Sentence 1: He was sentenced to five years in prison at Kingston Crown Court yesterday after pleading guilty to the attempted abduction of a teenager. Sentence 2: Former postal worker, Douglas Lindsell, was sentenced yesterday at Kingston Crown Court after pleading guilty to attempting to abduct a young girl. First, let's focus on the key elements in both sentences: a) Sentencing: In both sentences, the subject is being sentenced. - Sentence 1: \\"He was sentenced to five years in prison\\" directly states the sentence. - Sentence 2: \\"Douglas Lindsell, was sentenced yesterday\\" leaves out the duration of the sentence, but it still communicates that the person was sentenced. b) Location and date of sentencing: Both sentences indicate that the sentencing took place at the Kingston Crown Court. - Sentence 1: \\"at Kingston Crown Court yesterday\\" - Sentence 2: \\"yesterday at Kingston Crown Court\\" c) Plea: Both sentences describe the subject pleading guilty. - Sentence 1: \\"after pleading guilty to the attempted abduction\\" - Sentence 2: \\"after pleading guilty to attempting to abduct\\" d) Crime details: Although the phrasing differs slightly, it's clear the crime mentioned in both sentences is the attempted abduction of a young person. - Sentence 1: \\"attempted abduction of a teenager\\" - Sentence 2: \\"attempting to abduct a young girl\\" While the two sentences have slightly different styles and wording, their core message is the same: A person was sentenced to prison at Kingston Crown Court after pleading guilty to attempting to abduct a young person. The only discrepancies are that the first sentence does not provide the name of the person but specifies the sentence duration (\\"five years in prison\\"), while the second sentence provides the name (\\"Douglas Lindsell\\") and his previous occupation (\\"Former postal worker\\"), but does not mention the duration of the prison sentence.

AP (updated below - Update II) The New York Times' Tom Friedman, who did as much as any single individual to persuade large numbers of Democrats and \\"moderates\\" to support the invasion of Iraq, today writes: Former President George W. Bush’s gut instinct that this region craved and needed democracy was always right. It should have and could have been pursued with much better planning and execution. This war has been extraordinarily painful and costly. But democracy was never going to have a virgin birth in a place like Iraq, which has never known any such thing. Some argue that nothing that happens in Iraq will ever justify the costs. Historians will sort that out. Personally, at this stage, I only care about one thing: that the outcome in Iraq be positive enough and forward-looking enough that those who have actually paid the price -- in lost loved ones or injured bodies, in broken homes or broken lives, be they Iraqis or Americans or Brits -- see Iraq evolve into something that will enable them to say that whatever the cost, it has given freedom and decent government to people who had none. Sure, the war that I helped sell and cheered on led to the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of innocent human beings (at least), the long-term displacement of millions more, and the complete destruction of another country that had done nothing to us. But I'm not interested in clouding my mind with any of that. I don't care about that. That can be talked about once I'm dead. After all, as the great humanitarian Joseph Stalin taught us, you can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs, and as the great scholar and torturer Condoleezza Rice explained, we should just gently shut our eyes and think about the massive slaughter and destruction we caused in that country as mere \\"birth pangs\\" on the road to something beautiful. Back in 2003, I said -- with bloodthirsty sadism rabidly drooling from my mouth -- that the real purpose of the war, what made it the Right Thing to do, was that we needed to make large numbers of Muslims \\"suck. on. this\\" in order to show them we mean business, and we randomly picked Iraq because . . . . we could. But now -- to justify the enormous amounts of blood I helped spill and the incalculable amounts of human suffering I helped spawn -- I'm going to pretend that I was motivated by a magnanimous, noble desire to Spread Freedom. It was only a matter of time before American elites abandoned their faux regret over Iraq. For tribalists and nationalists, America can err in its execution but never in its motives. There's no question -- as this glorifying, propagandistic Newsweek cover story reflects -- that it's now official dogma that this was the right thing to do, or at least that we produced something great and wonderful for that country, as was our intent all along (leaving aside the what is actually happening in Iraq). It's nothing short of nauseating to watch those responsible glorify what they did without weighing -- or, in Friedman's case, affirmatively dismissing as irrelevant -- the extreme amounts of death and suffering that they caused, all based on false pretenses. But this is why Tom Friedman is the favorite propagandist of \\"Washington insiders\\"-- because he feeds them the justifications they need to feel good about themselves. Forget all those innocent dead people and destruction you caused; it all worked out in the end. UPDATE : Several people argue in Comments that this effort to portray the invasion of Iraq as a good thing is motivated not only by a desire for self-cleansing on the part of those responsible, but also to enable future, similar wars to take place. I don't know whether that's the motive, but it's definitely the effect. That the invasion of Iraq has been so widely perceived as a horrific debacle had the effect of minimizing the likelihood of future invasions. Having it now depicted as something that worked out and produced Great Results necessarily makes it easier to justify future wars in that region. After all, if attacking and invading Muslim countries we don't like in order to change their government is the good and right thing to do, shouldn't we keep doing it? ||||| I’m going to make a prediction: historians are not going to look kindly on the U.S. war in Iraq. First, a brief digression. Most major foreign policy writers in the U.S. decided to support the Iraq war. Most came to regret that decision, spending the next few years in print hemming and hawing and self-reflecting and criticizing the Bush administration’s incompetence. (As if Bush’s lack of brilliance should have come as a surprise–they must have missed the first nine episodes of “That’s My Bush!”) Very few media big wigs admitted the obvious: they supported the Iraq war because they got caught up in a phenomenon called ‘war fever,’ seen in most conflicts throughout history, and as members of the media, obligingly went along with the state’s desire to invade Iraq. In other words, everyone was doing it. But, in general, these media types are pretty vain people, and they think they’re pretty smart. Some of them are pretty smart, brilliant even. It would be an affront to their intellectual vanity to admit that they just got caught up in a particularly virulent mob mentality. That they’d been willing dupes. On the whole their reaction–rather than to take responsibility and admit the idea was obviously silly, undemocratic, and unjustified–has been to place the blame elsewhere. Paul Bremmer, George Bush, Ahmed Chalabi, Tommy Franks, George Tenet, Donald Rumsfeld etc. After the primary reason for the war turned out to be a hoax (WMD), and with it the debunking of the corollary reason for the war (fight the terrorists over there so we don’t have to fight them at home), they were stuck with that last powerful justification, bringing freedom to the Iraqi people. It’s always a persuasive and powerful argument: making the world safe for democracy and civilization has historically been a component of most cases for war that the U.S. has made. The argument also resurfaces each election that Iraq has had. The pictures of the purple fingers, and the euphoria that many Iraqis feel on voting day–at least they’re getting something out of the shit show they’ve had to live through–are hard to argue against. They appeal to an emotional, gut response, confirming to the American public that see, we’re the good guys after all. The election on Sunday was no exception. Now that Americans are no longer dying in Iraq–only Iraqis are dying in Iraq–those thinkers who supported the war then turned against the war are now slowly reclaiming their earlier positions. This admittedly weasel-like behavior is to be expected of columnists, I suppose, but I have to say that I have a lot more respect for the readable assholes like Christopher Hitchens and even a Richard Perle, who at least have had the courage to stand by their misguided ideas through the worst of it. Anyway. Rarely do foreign policy writers acknowledge their support of the war, or their complicity in promoting it. Nowadays, they don’t even have the guts to say they were right. What they do say–and I’ve seen it a bunch–is that history will be the judge, or some version of that line. Very vocal Iraq War supporter Thomas Friedman gives us an example of this in his column today, writing: Some argue that nothing that happens in Iraq will ever justify the costs. Historians will sort that out. Yes, some do argue that, and I am one of them. Let the historians sort that out, as they have sorted out other imperial and colonial wars, like the French in Algeria and Indochina, the British in Baghdad, the Belgians in the Congo, the Russians in Kabul, the Japanese in Nanking and, of course, the Americans in Vietnam, to name just a few. But humor me for a second as I quote myself. Here’s what I wrote last week before the election. Expect, too, a rash of commentary and columns from once-upon-a time war supporters who are now quietly taking the first tentative steps to reclaim their original positions. (Subtext: The war was um,er,uh, horrible and everything, but we were right after all…) Let’s go back to Friedman’s column. He writes: Former President George W. Bush’s gut instinct that this region craved and needed democracy was always right. It should have and could have been pursued with much better planning and execution. This war has been extraordinarily painful and costly. But democracy was never going to have a virgin birth in a place like Iraq, which has never known any such thing. Clearly, I’m like the Minority Report of bad Iraq columns. I could poke a few holes in his argument–might there not have been a peaceful and less costly ways to bring democracy to the Middle East, perhaps, say, by putting pressure on our autocratic allies like Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States before using the “long bomb” option on Iraq?–but I guess I’d just like to quote him one more time. Personally, at this stage, I only care about one thing: that the outcome in Iraq be positive enough and forward-looking enough that those who have actually paid the price — in lost loved ones or injured bodies, in broken homes or broken lives, be they Iraqis or Americans or Brits — see Iraq evolve into something that will enable them to say that whatever the cost, it has given freedom and decent government to people who had none. Like Friedman, I too hope that one day Iraq will be a positive and a peaceful place. But I am now going to take on the mantle of someone who has had friends and family and loved ones pay that price. I don’t do this very often. It’s an emotional case I’m about to make, not one based on a rational argument. ‘Whatever the cost.’I know the cost. It’s never going to be worth it. No need to wait for the historians to figure that one out. ||||| Of all the pictures I saw from the Iraqi elections last weekend, my favorite was on nytimes.com: an Iraqi expatriate mother, voting in Michigan, holding up her son to let him stuff her ballot into the box. I loved that picture. Being able to freely cast a ballot for the candidate of your choice is still unusual for Iraqis and for that entire region. That mother seemed to be saying: When I was a child, I never got to vote. I want to live in a world where my child will always be able to. God bless her. This was a very good day for Iraq. To say that mere voting or an election or two makes Iraq a success story would obviously be mistaken. An election does not a democracy make — and Iraq’s politicians still have yet to prove that they are up to governing, nation-building and both establishing and abiding by the rule of law. But this election is a big deal because Iraqis — with the help of the U.N., the U.S. military and the Obama team, particularly Vice President Joe Biden — overcame two huge obstacles. They overcame an array of sectarian disputes that repeatedly threatened to derail this election. And they came out to vote — Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds — despite the bombs set off by Al Qaeda and the dead-end Baathists who desperately want to keep the democracy project in Iraq from succeeding. This latter point is particularly crucial. The only way Al Qaeda, Baathism and violent Islamism will truly be defeated is when Arabs and Muslims themselves — not us — show they are willing to fight and die for a more democratic, tolerant and progressive future. Al Qaeda desperately wanted the U.S. project in Iraq to fail, but the Iraqi people just keep on keeping it alive.

But I am also sure you know what some of your people are quietly saying: “How come we Iranian-Persian-Shiites — who always viewed ourselves as superior to Iraqi-Arab-Shiites — can only vote for a handful of pre-chewed, pre-digested, ‘approved’ candidates from the supreme leader, while those lowly Iraqi Shiites, who have been hanging around with America for seven years, get to vote for whomever they want?” Unlike in Tehran, Iraqis actually count the votes.

Write a summary based on this article: Fewer U.S. women are having abortions than at any time since Roe v. Wade, according to new government figures released Wednesday. In 2015, the most recent year for which data is available, a total of 638,169 abortions were reported, a decrease of 2 percent from 652,639 abortions in 2014. The abortion rate was 11.8 abortions per 1,000 women ages 15-44 in 2015, compared with 12.1 in 2014 and 15.9 in 2006. In the years immediately after abortion was legalized nationwide in 1973, the number of legal abortions rose dramatically, reaching its peak in the 1980s. Abortions then began dropping at a slow rate until around 2006 to 2008, when they increased slightly, followed by even greater decreases in recent years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance report comes at a heated time for abortion politics in the country, with Trump administration officials introducing new policies to reduce funding to abortion providers and state legislatures debating ever more restrictive laws on abortion. Just this week, a federal court in Mississippi blocked the state’s ban against abortions past 15 weeks gestation. In signing the bill into law, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant (R) had said he hoped to make the state the “safest place in America for an unborn child.” While the CDC paper did not delve into the reasons for the decline, analysts have cited improved access to birth control, which has led to a decrease in unintended pregnancies, especially among teens, as well as the state laws regarding parental consent, waiting periods and other conditions that make it more difficult for women to get abortions. \\"Analyses have suggested that improved contraceptive use played a role in the long-term declines. In some states, decreased access to abortion services contributed, as well,” said Rachel Jones, principal research scientist for the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports women’s right to abortion. Abortion Surveillance - United States 2015, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Chuck Donovan, president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of Susan B. Anthony List, which opposes abortion, added other possible causes: “a higher percentage of women today decide to carry an unexpected pregnancy to term, teenagers are less sexually active and with fewer partners, pro-life views are more prevalent among the rising generation than they were 40 years ago.” He called the decline “sharp and consistent” and pointed out that the U.S. abortion rate is half of what it was in 1980. The data is isn’t 100 percent complete — California, Maryland and New Hampshire did not participate, and the reporting is better in some places than others — but it nonetheless provides a window into the overall trends and demographics of who is seeking abortions. The report shows tremendous variation by age, race and geographic region. While the abortion rate decreased across all age groups in 2015, women in their 20s accounted for nearly 60 percent of all abortions. The abortion rate was 19.9 for women ages 20-24 and 17.9 for ages 25-29. White women had the lowest abortion rate, at 6.8 abortions per 1,000 women, and black women had the highest abortion rate at 25.1 per 1,000. “The findings in this report indicate that the number, rate, and ratio of reported abortions have declined across all race/ethnicity groups but that well-documented disparities persist,” Tara C. Jatlaoui, from the CDC’s division of reproductive health, and co-authors wrote. There was also considerable variation among jurisdictions, from a rate of 2.8 abortions in South Dakota to 23.1 abortions in New York. One major source of controversy in recent years has been the widespread availability of medical abortions or pills such as RU-486 that can be taken to induce abortion without surgical intervention. In 2015, about a quarter of all abortions involved medical abortion, which can be done only early in a pregnancy. The report did not have information about deaths from complications of abortion in 2015, saying the data was still being assessed. In 2014, six women died as a result of legal induced abortion. ||||| (CNN) Abortion rates in the United States have dropped to their lowest level in 10 years, according to a report released Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. From 2006 to 2015, the year of the latest completed survey , reported abortions from participating areas fell 24%, from 842,855 to 638,169. Going back to 1969, the CDC has completed its \\"abortion surveillance\\" to measure the number and characteristics of women who obtain legal abortions. Requests for information go out to the central health agencies in all 50 states, plus Washington and New York City. The most recent surveillance included voluntary abortion data from 49 areas, the exceptions being California, Maryland and New Hampshire. What researchers found was a striking decrease from where abortion rates were a decade ago. In addition to the steep drop in the number of reported abortions, the rates fell in two other categories. The number of abortions among women 15-44 went down 26%, from 15.9 to 11.8 abortions per 1,000 women. And the number of abortions per 1,000 live births went down by 19%, from 233 to 188. Compared with the previous year, 2014, there was a 2% decrease in abortions across the three measures. Because reporting is voluntary and requirements for reporting vary across the country, the CDC acknowledges that the findings have limitations. The number of abortions reported to the CDC, for example, is 68% to 71% of the number established in a census of abortion providers by the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy group focused on reproductive health and rights, the report says. But still, the findings offer significant insights into how abortion is trending in the United States. \\"The new CDC report shows a continuation of long-term declines in abortions,\\" said Rachel Jones, principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute. \\"Analyses have suggested that improved contraceptive use played a role... In some states, decreased access to abortion services contributed as well.\\" Who's getting abortions The majority of women who had abortions in 2015 were in their 20s; 31.1% were aged 20-24 and 27.6% were aged 25-29. While decreases in abortion rates were seen across all age groups, the greatest decline over the decade was seen in adolescents. The rate of abortions in those aged 15-19 fell 54% between 2006 and 2015, the report shows. More than 59% of those who had abortions in 2015 were women who'd given birth before. More than 14% were women who'd had three or more births. A large percentage of women who had abortions in 2015 had had abortions before, according to the latest study. Nearly 44% had had one or more previous abortions; more than 8% had had three or more. Based on areas that reported race and ethnicity data, the largest percentages of abortions in 2015 were had by non-Hispanic white women (36.9%) and non-Hispanic black women (36%). Hispanic women accounted for 18.5% of all abortions in 2015, while non-Hispanic women of other races made up 8.7%. When and how are they getting abortions Nearly two-thirds of all abortions in 2015 were performed at no later than eight weeks of gestation. More than 91% of abortions happened at 13 weeks or less of gestation. Over the decade surveyed, the percentage of abortions performed at 13 weeks or more remained low, staying at 9% or less. And the percentage of earlier abortions increased, with those occurring at six weeks or less going up by 11%. Early medical abortion, a nonsurgical abortion at 8 weeks or less gestation, accounted for nearly 25% of abortions in 2015. Of those that were eligible for this method, which uses medications, nearly 36% of women opted for this approach. More than 64% of abortions were performed surgically at 13 or less weeks' gestation. About 9% were performed surgically after 13 weeks' gestation. The implications Surveillance of legal abortions in the US helps \\"to guide and evaluate the success of programs aimed at preventing unintended pregnancies,\\" the report says. According to the most recent study, unintended pregnancies in the United States have gone down from 51% in 2008 to 45% in 2011-2013. The rate of abortions can be influenced by a number of factors, the report shows, including availability of contraception, information and health care; access to abortion providers; changes in laws; and shifts in the economy and in attitudes about things like nonmarital childbearing.

Lowering the number of both unintended pregnancies and abortions often go hand-in-hand, the study shows. And you can't talk about unintended pregnancies without talking about abortions, said Jones of the Guttmacher Institute. \\"Affordable access to the full range of contraception and family planning options is critical for people deciding if and when they'd like to become parents, develop their careers, plan for their futures, and manage their health,\\" she said. \\"For women who become but do not want to remain pregnant, access to safe, legal abortion services remains critical.\\" ||||| NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. government agency said on Wednesday that abortion rates among American women of all ages fell to a decade low in 2015, which both opponents and supporters of abortion rights attributed in part to individual states’ efforts to restrict women’s access to the procedure. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that statistics for 2015, the most recent year for which data is available, show the abortion rate was 11.8 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44. That is down 26 percent from 2006, when the study began and the rate was 15.9 abortions per 1,000 women. Teens aged 15 to 19 experienced a greater decrease than older women, with the rate falling 54 percent from 2006 to 2015, the CDC said. “This decrease in abortion rate was greater than the decreases for women in any older age group,” the CDC said in a statement. The CDC did not provide any reason for the decline, but abortion rights advocates attributed it to increased use of contraceptives as well as decreased access to abortion services in some states. “Affordable access to the full range of contraception and family planning options is critical for people deciding if and when they’d like to become parents, develop their careers, plan for their futures and manage their health,” said Rachel Jones, research scientist at Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health think tank that supports abortion rights. Opponents of abortion rights said the decrease was primarily the result of many states’ efforts to restrict women’s access to the procedure. “That is due, in a significant way, to pro-life legislation that seeks to provide life-affirming solutions to abortion, combined with pro-life efforts that educate Americans about the effects of abortion and the humanity of the unborn child,” Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said in an email. The total number of reported abortions fell to 638,169 in 2015, from 842,855 in 2006, a 24 percent decrease. In 2015, there were 188 abortions per 1,000 live births, compared with 233 abortions per 1,000 live births in 2006, a drop of 19 percent. In 2015, all measures reached their lowest level for the entire period of analysis from 2006 to 2015, the CDC said of the annual study, “Abortion Surveillance - United States 2015.” Conservative state lawmakers are passing increasingly restrictive abortion laws in a challenge to Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 landmark decision that established that women have a constitutional right to an abortion.

[L2N1XW020] Such laws are designed to end up before the Supreme Court, which has become more conservative following President Donald Trump’s appointments of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. The CDC study also showed 91.1 percent of abortions performed in 2015 were in a woman’s first 13 weeks of pregnancy. There was also a shift toward earlier abortions, with the number performed at six weeks or less increasing 11 percent. |||||","completion":"Recently, a report shows that there are fewer women in the U.S. having abortions than before. In 2015, the number of abortions was 638,169, which is lower than the 652,639 in 2014. This is the lowest number since Roe v. Wade, which is when abortions became legal in 1973. The reason for this decline could be because of better access to birth control and state laws that make it more difficult for women to get abortions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion. Sometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work.

Hotel The answer is:","completion":"Title: Mourning Embrace Plot Outline: The story revolves around Ray and May's complex relationship and emotional journey following the loss of a mutual friend whose funeral brings them together. Step 1: Setting up the background and characters Ray and May were childhood friends who grew apart as time went by. They were united after years of no contact to attend the funeral of their mutual friend, Sam. Both are devastated by the loss, but the grief is not the only thing they are dealing with; there are unresolved feelings and past emotions to navigate. Step 2: The Funeral At the funeral, tensions and shared nostalgia mix as they are reminded of their past and the emotional rollercoaster that was their childhood friendship. Their connection, however, does not go unnoticed. Friends and family members sense that something lies beneath the surface, adding pressure to the already emotional situation. Step 3: Coming Closer Following the funeral, Ray and May have difficulty finding solace in the presence of others. As they escape the gathering, they find themselves drawn to each other, seeking comfort and understanding. They walk around the town, reminiscing about their shared past and uncovering feelings that had long been buried. Step 4: Hotel Room Decision Overwhelmed by their emotions, Ray and May realize they need a private space to continue their conversation and support each other. They agree to book a discreet hotel room to retreat to for the night. Step 5: The Night Once inside, the intimacy and privacy of the hotel room cause them to confront their unresolved feelings. As they share their thoughts, emotions, and regrets, they begin to reconnect on a deeper and more authentic level. The intense emotions and profound connection they feel lead them to have sex, both as an act of comfort and as a way to process their shared grief. Step 6: Aftermath and Reflection The next morning, Ray and May wake up to face reality. They understand that their night of intimacy was a shared moment of vulnerability that may not define their future relationship, but it's an essential part of their personal growth. They decide to give their friendship another chance, being entirely open and honest with each other and cherishing the bond they have always shared. Step 7: The Resolution As Ray and May exit the hotel, they agree to stay in touch and support one another as they navigate their lives following Sam's passing. The movie ends with the two setting up their next meeting, intent on regrowing their now intimate and understanding friendship.

Which researcher learned more about chlorine gases? Two researchers studied air quality over the North Pole, and over Antarctica. Dan was more fond of the south pole, so he studied Antarctica, while Colt liked reading about the North Pole. Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the question. The question is asking which researcher learned more about chlorine gases. Step 2: Locate relevant information in the text. The paragraph talks about the areas each researcher, Dan and Colt, studied: Dan studied Antarctica, while Colt studied the North Pole. The hint mentions that the ozone hole is created over Antarctica and that it is caused by chlorine and bromine gases. Step 3: Analyze the information. Since the hint mentions that the ozone hole (which is a direct result of chlorine and bromine gases) is over Antarctica, it is reasonable to infer that the researcher who studied Antarctica would have learned more about these gases.

For the best results, choose a white or light colored nylon suit. Use garbage bags, old towels, or an old tablecloth to protect surfaces. Work outside if possible. Acid dye will give you the best results. Choose one color for a monochrome design, or multiple colors for a more traditional tie dye look. Use rubber gloves to protect your skin while preparing the dye and while dyeing your swimsuit. Pull up small pieces of the fabric about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) apart and tie the material off with your rubber bands. Create interesting patterns by varying the amount of fabric you tie off and/or the spacing between each section. The longer you leave the suit in place, the darker the color will be. Rotate to a new section and a new color until the whole suit is covered with dye. Dyeing time can be anywhere between 5 and 20 minutes depending on the base color of the suit and how dark of a shade you want. When using multiple colors, expect some of the colors to run together at the edges and create a new color. This will add more interest and color to your suit and is preferable to leaving areas without dye coverage. If you are using only one color, you can use a large dye bath and fully submerge the suit once you've tied it off with rubber bands.

She mentioned wanting to buy something, but I can't recall what it was. Alice: Oh, I think I remember. She said she wanted to buy a blouse. She's been looking for the perfect one for a while now. Samantha: Oh right! A blouse. What was so special about the blouse she was looking for? Was there something specific she wanted? Alice: Yes, she mentioned that she's been searching for a while and hasn't found one she loves yet. She wants a blouse with a unique design that fits her style, but also something that's versatile enough to wear for both casual and more formal occasions. I think she said she was hoping to find one in a shade of blue that complements her eyes and is made of a comfortable, breathable fabric. Samantha: That sounds like a tall order! But I'm sure she'll find the perfect blouse eventually with those criteria in mind. Did she mention whether she prefers long sleeves or short sleeves? Alice: She was quite specific about wanting long sleeves, actually. Supposedly, it's because she loves how elegant they look and they also keep her warm during her work meetings, as her office tends to be on the cooler side. Samantha: I can understand that. Long sleeves can look really classy, especially if the blouse has some kind of interesting detail or cut. Was she leaning towards getting a blouse from any particular store or brand? Alice: She didn't mention a particular store or brand, no. But she did mention that she had been browsing online stores and a few local boutiques in the hopes of finding her perfect blouse. She even considered looking into having a custom blouse made if she couldn't find one that met all her criteria. Samantha: Wow, she's really determined to find this blouse! I admire her dedication. If she decides to go the custom route, I know a great seamstress that could probably help her out. I'll let her know about it. Alice: That's a great idea, Sam! I'm sure she would appreciate the recommendation. Hopefully, she can find that perfect blouse soon, whether it's ready-made or custom. Samantha: Agreed!

After two falling amateurs leave the family dangling, Royce forces Peter to cut him loose to save Peter and his sister. Peter has since retired from climbing, becoming a full-time wildlife photographer, and Annie has gone on to become a renowned mountain climber. Their relationship is strained as Annie still blames Peter for obeying Royce instead of waiting for her to secure the rope. Three years later, during a wildlife photo shoot for National Geographic in the lower Himalayas in Pakistan, Peter's assistant falls and breaks his leg and has to be evacuated by the Pakistani Army stationed in a military station that monitors avalanches. Peter is dropped off at K2 Base Camp and searches for Annie who is planning a summit attempt on K2, the world's second highest and most dangerous mountain. The expedition is funded by wealthy industrialist Elliot Vaughn (Paxton) who is also taking part as he wants to attempt climbing the K2 for the second time after his first attempt ended in tragedy with him as sole survivor. Vaughn has the help of renowned climber Tom McLaren (Nicholas Lea) and other expedition members include Pakistani mountaneer Ali Nazir. The day before the climb Vaughn throws a promotional party with all the people at base camp that is interrupted by reclusive Montgomery Wick (Glenn), reported to be the world's best climber and foremost expert on K2, who asks if it will be Vaughn or the experienced McLaren who will be making the decisions during the climb, as the team cannot have two leaders. Vaughn states that McLaren is the leader and later on explains that Wick is against him because his wife, a Sherpa guide, was one of the people who did not survive his previous expedition.

The Scottish First Minister confirmed that he stayed in the luxury Peninsula Hotel in Chicago during a trip to the Ryder Cup last year. It is one of the of the most exclusive hotels in the city and Mr Salmond has come under-fire for the stay which came during the official handover ceremony of the trophy.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: I'm going to take something that happened to my daughter for this answer. Billie Jo (our daughter) was probably around ten years old when it happened. We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to. The list grew longer as the months passed. Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me. She also had a habit of grabbing the mail as it slid through the slot that was in our front door, taking it out back and 'sorting' it for us. So what happened really came as no big surprise. My daughter was a very diligent student, never wanting to let down her teachers by not turning her homework in as soon as she got to school (at least until she hit 14). One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before. My wife assisted in the search and soon found a partially chewed up piece of our daughter's homework page. Our daughter was devastated! How could she possibly walk in to school and publicly announce, “My dog ate my homework!” without becoming the laughing stock of the school? Like this: Mama Bear (my wife) storms into the classroom and vehemently upholds our daughter's “dog ate my homework” bit, showing the teacher the half eaten paper. Funny thing was, the teacher would have never doubted our little girl for one minute. Back then, Billie Jo was the sweetest, cutest, most polite and well mannered child a parent could possibly hope for. And her teachers loved her. So, if you have partial proof, it can be a valid excuse. Why was the daughter devestated? - not enough information - because she was late for school - because the dog ate her homework - because she fell in a sticker bush Answer:","completion":"The daughter was devastated because the dog ate her homework.

Solution:","completion":"To answer this question, let's first understand the process and the guidelines provided: Process: 1. You inhale. 2. Your diaphragm moves down. 3. Your lungs have more room. 4. Your lungs fill with air. 5. You exhale. 6. Your diaphragm moves back up. 7. Carbon dioxide is exhaled. 8. You start the process over again.

Now let's apply the guidelines to the question: Question: What is the effect of less air being pulled from outside the body on a greater amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream? Considering the process, when you inhale, your lungs fill with air, which is then used to deliver oxygen to the bloodstream. Thus, if less air is pulled from outside the body, it means that there is less air (containing oxygen) available to be delivered to the bloodstream. This suggests that the first event has a negative effect on the second event.

There are several reasons for this conclusion: 1. The user writes that the video was sold as \\"NEW,\\" but it did not arrive in the expected condition. It had no plastic seal and appeared to have already been opened. This suggests that the product may have been falsely advertised or mishandled, which can be frustrating for a customer who was expecting a brand-new item. 2. The user expresses deep disappointment in the product because it was intended as a gift. This highlights the importance of the product's condition and presentation, especially when it's meant for someone else. The fact that the product seemed used or opened could potentially have a negative impact on the gifting experience, making it less likely that the user would recommend this product to others. 3. The reviewer uses strong language to convey their feelings about the product, such as \\"DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED.\\" This indicates a significant level of dissatisfaction and reinforces the idea that the user would not recommend this product based on their experience.

By Snejana Farberov Playboy magnate: Marc Leder, 50, the co-CEO of Sun Capital Partners, has become notorious for hosting wild parties in the Hamptons A secretly taped video featuring Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney unfavorably sounding off on President Barack Obama’s supporters was recorded at the house of a playboy hedge fund manager who has gained notoriety for debauched sex parties, according to latest reports. Marc Leder, 50, the co-CEO of Sun Capital Partners in Boca Raton, Florida, hosted a fundraiser for the former governor of Massachusetts in May. During the exclusive 50,000-a-plate event, Romney was caught on video dismissing the 47 per cent of Americans who allegedly support President Obama as freeloaders who depend on the government. The Republican candidate said that","completion":"these people believe they are entitled to healthcare, food, housing, and other basic needs, suggesting that this segment of the population is not concerned with personal responsibility or contributing to society. This controversial remark drew widespread criticism and was widely reported in the media, significantly impacting Romney's presidential campaign and public image. At the heart of this media storm was Marc Leder, whose extravagant and notorious parties have made headlines in recent years. Leder, who made his fortune managing hedge funds, is a well-known figure in both the financial world and the social scene of the Hamptons, an exclusive enclave on Long Island in New York, popular among the rich and famous for its lavish mansions and pristine beaches. Leder's wild parties have become the stuff of legend in the area, with jealous neighbors whispering about the opulent gatherings he hosts at his luxurious 500,000-per-month rented estate. These affairs are said to involve an eclectic mix of guests, ranging from Wall Street tycoons to celebrities, artists, and the occasional famous politician. According to insiders, the parties often involve excessive drinking, drugs, and scandalous sexual escapades. It was at one of these infamous gatherings that Romney's candid statements about the significant portion of the American population who support President Obama were secretly taped. The recording quickly went viral, sparking heated debates both about Romney's assertions and the ethics of recording and releasing such a video. The incident not only fueled the image of Romney as an out-of-touch elitist who did not understand or empathize with struggling Americans but also cast a spotlight on the exclusive world of the ultra-wealthy, and their apparent disregard for the less fortunate. The revelation that it was Leder's event at which the controversial video was recorded only served to heighten the intrigue around this playboy hedge fund manager. As the public struggled to understand how a man who enjoyed such a debauched lifestyle could choose to align himself with a conservative political candidate, many questions were raised about the nature of political fundraising and the role of money in American politics. In the wake of the scandal, both Romney and Leder faced negative repercussions. Romney's presidential ambitions were dealt a significant blow, with many pointing to the leaked video as a turning point in the 2012 election. The once-promising candidate ultimately lost to President Obama, and his political career never fully recovered. Leder, on the other hand, faced increased scrutiny of his personal life and business dealings. His risqué reputation became inextricably linked with the Romney scandal, damaging his social standing and leaving many in the Hamptons trading gossip about his tarnished name. While he continued to wield considerable influence in the financial world, Leder's political affiliations and party-hosting days were seemingly curtailed by the fallout from the infamous leaked video. Thus, the story of Romney's downfall and the ensuing scandal provides a cautionary tale about the dangers of political fundraising in a world of increasing surveillance and moral complexity. At the center of it all was Marc Leder, the playboy hedge fund magnate, whose wild parties ultimately played an unexpected role in shaping the course of American politics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Doctors gave sedative to the patient complaining of pain, what did he say afterwards? Possible A: enjoyment, good sometimes, immobilize, feels good, good feeling Why is \\"feels good\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Feels good\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. Firstly, it is essential to understand the context of the question. The question posed is related to the medical field and focuses on a patient receiving sedatives, which are drugs specifically prescribed to alleviate pain, relax muscles, and reduce anxiety or agitation. Given this context, it is natural to expect the patient's response to express relief or satisfaction, which is reflected in the answer \\"feels good.\\" Secondly, the options given for the answer are: enjoyment, good sometimes, immobilize, feels good, and good feeling. Analyzing these options individually: 1. \\"Enjoyment\\" refers to a sensation of pleasure or joy that may be unrelated to the relief from pain or anxiety. In the given context, it may indicate that the individual has a casual or frivolic approach towards consuming sedatives which may lead to potential misuse, misunderstanding, or risks associated with drugs. 2. \\"Good sometimes\\" is vague because it does not explicitly convey whether the sedative provided relief for the specific situation in question. The occasional nature of the relief may also not provide an adequate responsibility expected from the doctors in the scenario. 3. \\"Immobilize\\" implies that the patient's physical movement is hindered or restricted. While sedatives may relax muscles, this term does not directly address the feelings of relief or pain reduction experienced by the patient. 4. \\"Feels good\\" directly indicates that the patient experiences a positive sensation, likely as a result of relief from pain or anxiety. It reflects a reasonable response to the effective administration of sedatives by doctors. 5. \\"Good feeling\\" is similar to \\"enjoyment\\" and may also indicate an unnecessarily positive or frivolic association with sedatives. The term does not focus on relief from pain or anxiety, which are the intended purposes of sedatives. Considering these explanations, \\"feels good\\" is the most appropriate response from a human common sense perspective. It aligns with the intended purpose of sedatives and conveys that the patient experienced relief or relaxation after being administered the medication. The other options, though relevant, either lack direct clarity in expressing the effect of sedatives or may convey a potential for misuse or misinterpretation of medical prescriptions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. News article: You may love your Tesla, but that doesn’t make it any less prone to accidents than other cars. If you want an example, consider that a Tesla driver in Utah recently found that his Model S loaner had parked itself automatically into the back of a trailer. After analyzing logs, the carmaker told him that he’s the only person to blame for the accident. Apparently, the car’s auto-parking feature was initiated, which is why the car hit the back of the trailer. DON’T MISS: Amazon’s 12 best daily deals: A 50 smartphone, a 150 smart TV, and plenty more The Summon feature is still in beta and requires human oversight. Tesla advises users to monitor the self-parking feature at all times and intervene to avoid obstacles that could cause accidents. The driver, Jared Overton, said that he did not activate the Summon feature and that he was near the vehicle for some 20 seconds talking about it with a nearby worker at the business he was visiting. Overton said he parked well behind the trailer, but the car somehow drove itself into it, failing to detect the trailer’s bed. Overton and the worker discovered the car a few minutes later when exiting the business. “We were trying to figure out how on earth the vehicle started on its own,” Overton told KSL. “What happened with this kind of rogue vehicle?” Tesla sent a letter to Overton telling him that it was practically his fault, suggesting he may have invoked the Summon feature and that he may have failed to monitor the car. “Tesla has reviewed the vehicle’s logs, which show that the incident occurred as a result of the driver not being properly attentive to the vehicle’s surroundings while using the Summon feature or maintaining responsibility for safely controlling the vehicle at all times,” the letter said. The Summon feature “was initiated by a double-press of the gear selector stalk button, shifting from Drive to Park and requesting Summon activation” Tesla explained. It all happened three seconds after Overton exited the car and closed the door, the letter explained. The driver disagrees, saying that even if he accidentally started Summon, he would have been able to hear it and stop it. “Even during that 15, 20-second walk right here, we would have easily heard the impact of the vehicle into the back of the trailer,” Overton said. “They can tell me what they want to tell me with the logs, but it doesn’t change what we know happened here.” “They’re just assuming that I sat there and watched it happen, and I was OK with that,” Overton said. A Tesla spokesperson told KSL that the Summon feature is in beta, and each driver has to agree to certain terms and conditions before enabling it. These conditions say that the driver has to be in proximity of the car when using its autonomous features to be able to assume manual control if something goes wrong. “This feature will park Model S while the driver is outside the vehicle,” the statement said. “Please note that the vehicle may not detect certain obstacles, including those that are very narrow (e.g., bikes), lower than the fascia, or hanging from the ceiling. As such, Summon requires that you continually monitor your vehicle’s movement and surroundings while it is in progress and that you remain prepared to stop the vehicle at any time using your key fob or mobile app or by pressing any door handle. You must maintain control and responsibility for your vehicle when using this feature and should only use it on private property.” Overton said the statement practically dismissed the experience of two witnesses. “Imagine if a child was right there — I guarantee that they would be responding to this a lot differently,” Overton said. “I will not feel safe with my little boy playing in the garage or the driveway if there’s the potential for a rogue vehicle.” ||||| A Tesla owner in Utah says that he returned to his parked Model S to find that it had crept forward and crashed into the trailer parked ahead of it. The man claims that this all went down without explanation; Tesla refutes that claim, saying that after taking a look at the car's logs, it determined that the Summon feature had been activated, which autonomously calls the car to (or from) the waiting driver without anyone behind the wheel. The owner says that he was answering questions about the car from a passerby, so it's entirely possible that he opened the app and accidentally activated Summon (for what it's worth, he claims he didn't). But here's the thing: it doesn't matter. Under no circumstances should a production vehicle autonomously collide with a parked vehicle mere feet ahead of it. I think that's common sense, right? Am I saying anything controversial? As a refresher, here's Tesla's video explaining how Summon works: A letter to the owner from a regional Tesla service manager obtained by KSL says that \\"the incident occurred as a result of the driver not being properly attentive to the vehicle's surroundings while using the Summon feature or maintaining responsibility for safely controlling the vehicle at all times.\\" Perhaps! But cars — by virtue of the fact that people of all walks of life and levels of attentiveness use them — are supposed to be far more bulletproof than this by the time they reach production. It's why the FCA just recalled over a million cars with confusing shift levers, because a driver who isn't paying attention could fail to put it in park. In other words, Summon — and similar features that will inevitably come from other manufacturers — can't rely on an attentive owner to keep the car from smashing into something. It's one of the reasons why Google and a half-dozen automakers are moving more slowly with commercial autonomous deployments. Tesla will be quick to note that Summon is \\"in beta,\\" but owners are going to use it either way, and unfortunately, we can't always expect them to use good judgement. We can't be required to be smarter than the software The notion of safety-critical \\"beta\\" software in deployment on commercial vehicles is a relatively new one, and it's something that regulatory agencies aren't equipped to deal with. I suspect that in a decade or two, there will be a well-established framework of tests that systems like Summon will have to pass before being allowed on a production car. But for now, it's the Wild West. In a statement to KSL, Tesla says that Summon \\"may not detect certain obstacles, including those that are very narrow (e.g., bikes), lower than the fascia, or hanging from the ceiling.\\" In this incident, the trailer is very high — it only comes as low as the midpoint of the Model S's windshield. But we've seen autonomous vehicles solve much harder problems than this (just watch any of Nvidia's keynotes on computer vision in self-driving cars from the past couple years). And coincidentally, the Model S is equipped with a forward-facing camera mounted at rear view mirror height. That is to say: \\"beta\\" or no, owner liability disclaimer or no, a car capable of autonomously crashing itself into a stationary object in normal operating conditions should never have been sold. Tested, yes — sold, no. We humans just aren't smart enough to handle something like that.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What camp used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge?, using the article: The bank building was bought in 1944 by D. L. King of Rogers, who remodeled it and made it home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it was nothing more than an empty, roofless, concrete shell.In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row were sold to Springdale businessmen Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack. Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, leaving only a small section standing.Oklahoma Row continued to provide lodging, although it was run and managed by several different people. In June 1946, Company G of the Arkansas State Guard held camp at Monte Ne for field training, using the hotel facilities. Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department blacktopped 1.4 miles (2.25 km) of the Monte Ne road. In January, six Monte Ne men were arrested for grand larceny, charged with stealing doors from Oklahoma Row and 500 feet (152 m) of pipe from the swimming pool. A resident of the area, Iris Armstrong opened up a girls' camp just east of the amphitheater in 1922. She named it Camp Joyzelle, after the Maurice Maeterlinck play of the same name. The camp made use of the amphitheater for plays and its cabins, named after Greek goddesses, dotted the hillside. Oklahoma Row was used in 1945 for lodging people who had come to visit the campers. It was used for this purpose up until 1962 as well as for social events and activities such as plays and campfire ceremonies. The camp also used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge and crafts building. In 1955 Dallas Barrack, a Springdale antique dealer, bought Oklahoma Row, and renovated it into an antique store called the Palace Art Galleries.

Every year, without fail, I feel a little bit depressed on the First of March. I absolutely love summer. I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies. Once the body parts have been harvested, they are stored in Formaldehyde to be preserved. The Formaldehyde alters the proteins in the tissue to stop them breaking down - fine for the dead, not something I want to use whilst I am alive. It is nasty, nasty stuff. The author has probably: A.

In court documents published on Monday, it came to light that the men had discussed attacking an African - American school and killing 14 of them. Another crime was about planning to murder Presidential candidate Barack Obama. According to their affidavits , the suspects' \\"final act of violence\\" would be when they attacked Obama while wearing white suits and top hats and driving \\"their vehicle as fast as they could toward Obama shooting at him from the windows.\\" The two suspects are Paul Schlesselman, 18, of West Helena, Arkansas and Daniel Cowart, 20, of Bells, Tennessee. According to the court papers, they met last month over the Internet through a friend. Schlesselman and Cowart are believed to share \\"very strong views\\" about White Power. Schlesselman listed \\"being racist\\" as his occupation on his MySpace page. He further wrote: \\"I'm white. I'm proud. I get angry. I like guns.\\" Cowart also had a MySpace page on which photos of guns were presented under a heading of \\"My Guns\\". On his page he wrote, \\"Better to die quick fighting on your feet than to live forever begging on your knees.\\" Some have questioned the pair's ability to carry out the charged plan, but authorities have been very concerned about Obama as the first black presidential candidate from a major party. \\"We honestly don't know if they had the ability or the skill to carry out the kind of plan that they talked about.\\" said Malcolm Wiley, of the United States Secret Service in an interview with The New York Times. \\"But we take any threat seriously no matter how big or how small it is.\\" Cowart and Schlesselman are scheduled to appear before a judge on Thursday. 1.

Projects keep piling, deadlines looming, and no end in sight. Coffee machines broke down too, what's next? Productivity is taking a nosedive. Could do with a bit of luck for a change...#toughday #stressful\\" This tweet is a reflection of negative emotions. It expresses dissatisfaction and stress related to work, the brewing tension of upcoming deadlines, the breakdown of coffee machines (which could be seen as a small but important coping mechanism during stressful work situations), and the overall decrease in productivity. The hashtags 'toughday' and 'stressful' further signify the exasperation and negativity experienced by the poster. Emotions such as unhappiness, frustration, and discontentment underpin these kind of negative sentiment tweets. Sentiment analysis, often used in data analysis and AI programming, would categorize this tweet as negative based on the implicit dissatisfaction and explicit complaints about the user's day at work. Negative sentiment can be used to identify individuals' areas of complaint or dissatisfaction, which can provide useful feedback to organizations if the negative sentiment is directed towards them or their products/services. It's worth noting that just as with individual people, the sentiment behind a tweet can be complex and contain elements of several emotions simultaneously. Similarly, interpreting the sentiment of a tweet can also be a complex task, particularly for AI if the language used employs sarcasm, cultural references, or other nuanced elements of language that simple keyword recognition may miss."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near their farm? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Kenny will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near his farm. This is because Kenny is currently using a low amount of fertilizer, as he mainly grows tomatoes which are not in season right now. On the other hand, Bobby has increased his fertilizer usage dramatically due to his large potato order. When rain dissolves the fertilizers in the soil, runoff carries it away and eventually deposits the nitrogen-rich fertilizer into nearby bodies of water, including ponds. This excess nitrogen causes the growth of algae to rapidly increase, depleting carbon dioxide levels in the water. When the algae die, decomposers break them down and use up the oxygen in the process, leading to the creation of dead zones. Since Kenny is using less fertilizer than Bobby, the likelihood of dead zones forming in ponds near Kenny's farm is lower compared to ponds near Bobby's farm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. Now, I have a new situation: The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't. Answer this question please: Which group of larvae had more changes in their RNA sequence? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while Group D did not. Therefore, Group L had more changes in their RNA sequence as compared to Group D.

Movie title: Four Christmases Movie plot: Brad (Vince Vaughn) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon) are an upscale San Francisco couple. Having both come from dysfunctional families, with divorced parents and siblings with out-of-control kids, the two disdain the idea of getting married or having kids. In an effort to avoid their families at Christmas, the two go on vacation abroad while pretending to be doing charity work there. The third Christmas of their relationship, Brad and Kate are trapped at San Francisco International Airport by a fog bank that cancels every outbound flight, and interviewed by a news crew, alerting their families to the fact they're stuck at home for the holidays. With no way to get out of it, Kate and Brad find themselves visiting their families on Christmas Day. They first visit Brad's father (Robert Duvall), then Kate's mother (Mary Steenburgen), then Brad's mother (Sissy Spacek) and, finally, Kate's father (Jon Voight), thereby celebrating four Christmases in one day. As they brace themselves for a marathon of homecomings, Brad and Kate expect the worst, but are nevertheless unable to prepare themselves enough for what they get. As the day progresses, each discover a new secret about their partner that they had previously been too embarrassed to share, namely that Brad's real name is \\"Orlando\\", and Kate has a fear of inflatable castles, stemming from being ostracized as a child, and these discoveries put an intense strain on their relationship. While Brad counts down the minutes to freedom, Kate finds herself looking at the lives of Brad's and her own siblings and comes to realize that she does want a marriage and children of her own, the prospect of which frightens Brad when she mentions it to him. Eventually, in the final visit of the day, at Kate's father's house, Kate asks Brad to let her spend the visit on her own and claims to her family that they had split up. Meanwhile, Brad spends some time at his own father's house with just his father and realises that he wants a marriage and children, and that he loves Kate way too...

On June 15, 2007, the Jaguars released veteran strong safety Donovin Darius, who had seen diminished playing time in previous years due to mounting injuries. On August 31, 2007, the Jaguars announced that long time back-up quarterback David Garrard would start for the team, ahead of former first round draft pick Byron Leftwich, who was released in the teams final roster cuts. Garrard led the Jaguars to an 11–5 record and a wild card spot in the 2007–08 NFL playoffs. The Jaguars defeated the 2007 Pittsburgh Steelers season 31–29 to win their first playoff game in almost eight years and their first road playoff win since 1997. It was also the first time in the 50+ year history of the Steelers that they had been beaten twice at home by the same team in the same season. However, in the divisional round, the Jaguars fell to the then-undefeated 2007 New England Patriots season; the teams were tied at halftime, but the Patriots pulled ahead and won 31–20. Tom Brady completed 26 of 28 passes in this game, being pressured by the Jaguars defense only once, on the first play.

Joseph speaks with high pitch voice.. (B). Craig speaks with high pitch voice.. Complete the following sentence. Joseph plugs his ear when he is with Craig because","completion":"Joseph plugs his ear when he is with Craig because Craig speaks with a high pitch voice (B). Craig's high-pitched voice might make it difficult for Joseph to feel comfortable or focus on the conversation, leading him to take measure to avoid auditory discomfort. High pitch voices can sometimes be challenging for individuals to tolerate due to their frequency and tone. This might cause people to instinctively plug their ears or move away in order to protect their hearing and maintain a sense of auditory comfort. Although Craig may not necessarily mean to cause any discomfort to others, his naturally high-pitched voice might become a source of irritation or distraction to those around him, particularly to people who are sensitive to certain noises and sounds, like Joseph. In some cases, people might find high pitch voices annoying, as they can lead to headaches or even nausea in extreme situations. This is because the human brain works to process and filter different sounds that we hear, and our inner ear plays a significant role in maintaining balance and spatial orientation. When we experience disruptive frequencies, such as a high-pitched voice, our auditory system might be overstimulated, causing discomfort or difficulty in processing the sounds. Joseph could be engaging in a self-preservation technique by plugging his ear in order to reduce the impact of Craig's high pitched voice on his auditory system. This might help Joseph maintain his ability to concentrate and participate in the conversation without becoming distracted or overwhelmed by the high pitch. Additionally, Joseph's decision to plug his ear might stem from his attempt to send a subtle message to Craig that his high pitched voice has a negative effect on him. Whether intentional or not, this action could potentially prompt a discussion around the matter and lead to a more comfortable environment for both individuals in their future interactions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","completion":"This movie review sentence is positive. The reviewer has used several strong, complimentary adjectives to describe the film, which indicate a favorable impression. Firstly, the word \\"breathtakingly\\" is a powerful modifier that suggests the movie has exceeded expectations and elicited a strong emotional reaction. It indicates the reviewer is impressed and almost overwhelmed by how good the film is. Secondly, the reviewer mentions the film as being \\"assured,\\" which denotes confidence in the execution and delivery of the story by the director (in this instance, Jeffs). This word choice suggests that the movie's vision is clear, and the director was able to communicate it effectively, resulting in a strong, cohesive final product. The term \\"stylish\\" implies that the film's aesthetics are both visually appealing and artistically significant. It suggests that the movie stands out in terms of design and cinematography, contributing to a unique and memorable experience for the audience. Furthermore, the \\"spare dialogue\\" mentioned in the review highlights the film's minimalist approach to conversation, which is seen as a positive aspect. It suggests that the dialogue is concise and to the point but still manages to convey the intended emotions and messages effectively. This indicates the reviewer respects the movie's ability to rely on other elements – such as visual storytelling or the actors' performances – to communicate with the audience. Lastly, the phrase \\"acute expressiveness\\" showcases the film's powerful delivery of emotions and feelings. This indicates that the movie is successful in evoking deep, intense emotions within the viewer, further supporting the positive nature of the review. In conclusion, this movie review sentence is resoundingly positive, as the reviewer uses multiple adjectives to praise the film's visual appeal, dialogue, emotional depth, and directorial confidence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: Image copyright FBI Image caption The Hellers purchased the painting, one of Chagall's early works from his time in Paris, in the 1920s A Marc Chagall painting stolen from a New York couple's home in 1988 will be returned to the family's estate after nearly 30 years, the FBI says. The 1911 painting, Othello and Desdemona, was taken from Ernest and Rose Heller's flat with more than a dozen other works of art and jewellery. The Chagall was recovered last year after a Washington, DC gallery owner twice refused to purchase the painting. He told the seller to contact the authorities for proof of ownership. \\"We took the case from there,\\" said Special Agent Marc Hess, a member of the FBI Art Crime Team. The Maryland man who tried to sell the work had stored it in his attic for years in a customised box he fashioned out of a door jamb and plywood, according to Mr Hess. He was given the painting in the late 1980s or early 1990s from another man who is suspected of taking it from the Upper East Side building where the Hellers lived, prosecutors said in a court filing on Thursday. The couple owned works of art by Renoir, Picasso, Hopper and Chagall, the bureau said. Mr Heller was a retired jewel importer who died in 1998 and his wife passed away in 2003. The Maryland man, who has not been named, said he planned to sell the stolen Chagall to a potential buyer, but the deal fell through after a dispute over his cut of the earnings, the FBI said. Instead, he kept the painting in his attic and attempted to sell it in 2011 and again in 2017. The painting, which depicts Shakespeare's Othello holding a sword as he gazes down at his bride, Desdemona, was still marked with the names of its owners, \\"Mr + Mrs ES Heller, New York\\", when the Maryland man tried to sell it, according to the Washington Post. The art gallery owner rebuffed his offer, noted that it required documents proving ownership and referred the man to the FBI, according to prosecutors. \\"Well-documented and known art is very hard to move once it has been stolen,\\" said FBI Supervisory Special Agent Tim Carpenter. \\"Gallery owners are our first line of defence in identifying pieces of art that do not have the appropriate documentation and should be brought to the attention of law enforcement.\\" Prosecutors asked a court on Thursday to approve the return of the painting to the family's estate to put up for auction. The proceeds will be given to the insurance company that paid the theft claim and to charities supported by the family estate. Statute of limitations laws on the robbery have expired, which means the suspected thief and the Maryland man will not face charges. The suspected thief was previously convicted in federal court and served a prison term in connection with selling other stolen property, the agency said. Alan Scott, an attorney for Mr Heller's estate and is the executor for Mrs Heller, told the Washington Post \\"of all the works that could have been recovered, this is the one that would have pleased them the most\\". ||||| Thirty years after it was stolen, an early Marc Chagall has been recovered by the FBI. The painting, titled Othello and Desdemona, belonged to retired jeweler and art collector Ernest “Pick” Heller and his wife Rose “Red” Heller, and was stolen from their New York apartment back in 1988, along with numerous other paintings, sculptures, and art objects including jewelry, carpets, silverware, and Steuben china. “We often work on recoveries that are over 25 years old but this one is unique for the outstanding work performed by law enforcement 30 years after the theft,” Chris Marinello of Art Recovery, who represents the Hellers’ insurance company, told artnet News in an email. “The FBI and US Attorney’s Office could have easily dismissed this matter as ‘ancient history’ but they pursued it with precision and vigor.” Ernest and Rose, then 85 and 88, had returned from their annual two-month trip to Aspen, Colorado, only to find their apartment had been robbed. They had an alarm system installed, but there was no sign of a break in. Today, investigators believe the theft was committed by someone who worked in the building and had access to the security system. The culprit was, according to a statement, later “convicted in federal district court of interstate transportation of stolen property and mail fraud related to the theft and sale of other works of art from other apartment buildings.” In addition to Chagall, the couple owned some 21 paintings and 12 sculptures in all, including works by August Renoir, Othon Friesz, Georges Rouault, Pablo Picasso, and Edward Hopper. At the time of the robbery, the couple’s stolen property was collectively valued at an estimated 600,000. Adjusting for inflation, that would be 1.3 million today. “It was a lifetime of collecting,” Ernest told UPI at the time of the crime. “I liked them all, but the Chagall was a very interesting one because it was a 1911 painting.” He expressed his doubts that his stolen valuables would ever be recovered. To date, Othello and Desdemona is the only piece from the heist to have been found; 13 other paintings remain missing. The FBI’s Art Crime Team tracked down the painting with the help of a gallery in Washington, DC. According to a complaint filed today in US District Court and titled United States v. One Oil Painting Entitled Othello and Desdemona by Marc Chagall for the District of Columbia, “Person 1” approached “Person 2” in the late 1980s or early ’90s, for help selling the stolen Chagall to persons involved with Bulgarian organized crime. The deal fell through, after the first party tried to cut the second out of the deal—they later accused the second, who wound up with the painting, of stealing the work. (Because of the ongoing investigation into the other paintings whereabouts, the FBI is not revealing the names of any of the parties involved.) Person 2 brought the painting to the DC gallery in 2011, and again in 2017. An unidentified third party had previously brought the painting to the gallery back in 1989. All three times, the dealer said they could not help sell the piece without proof of ownership and provenance. Encouraged by the gallery, and now 72-years-old, terminally ill, and looking to clear his conscience, Person 2 finally contacted the FBI, who took possession of the painting in January 2017. Today’s filing is a civil forfeiture, which allows the government to seize stolen property without starting criminal proceedings against a suspected guilty party. “That doesn’t mean that we aren’t going to prosecute someone later,” noted Zia Faruqui, the prosecutor on the case, in a phone call with artnet News. Othello and Desdemona had been appraised at Sotheby’s for 50,000–65,000 in 1974. It was originally purchased by Ernest’s father Samuel Heller for just 50 in 1913. A student at Ècole Julien Art School in Paris, Samuel was friends with Fernand Léger, who likely introduced him to Chagall. After seizing the painting, the FBI discovered a label on the back, in German, that identified “Mr. + Mrs. E.S. Heller, New York” as the “besitzer,” the German word for owner. The couple had lent the piece to a Chagall exhibition at the Kunsthaus Zurich in Geneva, Switzerland in 1967—and even rebuffed an offer from a local gallery interested in buying it. “We were fairly luckily because the tag from Zurich had a space for owners,” FBI case agent Marc Hess admitted to artnet News. From there, investigators were able to track down news articles about the theft, and contact Alan Scott, the lawyer for the Hellers’ estate, who confirmed that the painting was their stolen property. “Both of the Hellers were philanthropic and highly active in the NYC arts scene in the mid-20th century,” Scott told artnet News. Ernest Heller died in 1998 at 95, and Rose Heller in 2003 at 105. They had nieces and nephews, but their will primarily benefitted the MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, New Hampshire, a contemporary art residency. The proceeds of the painting’s sale will be split between MacDowell (80 percent) and New York’s Columbia University and NYU Medical Center (10 percent each). “Normally, the insurance company claims the entire proceeds in cases like this, but given that the money would be going to charity, the company agreed to take just their pay-out amount and nothing more,” said Marinello. He said the Hellers had received 100,000 from their insurance policy for the stolen painting. Today, according to the artnet Price Database, Chagall’s work routinely sells for millions at auction. His record is 28.45 million for Les Amoureux, a 1928 canvas of a man and women embracing. The painting, sold in November at Sotheby’s New York, is said to depict the artist’s first wife and great love, Bella Rosenfeld. Othello and Desdemona, however, is unlikely to reach similar heights. “It’s not a particularly attractive painting, nor from the photograph does it appear to be in particularly good condition,” art adviser Todd Levin told artnet News. “Similar pieces have sold in the relatively recent past, and I think they’d be lucky to get 600,000 today, including buyer’s premium.” “A sensible auction estimate would be 300,000–500,000, and it’s very possible that the painting might not sell at all,” he added. “This is not an important painting in the artists’ output by subject matter, scale, period, or in any other way.” Levin noted that the fact that the work had been missing for so many years would probably only diminish its value, due to the likelihood that the painting was improperly stored. Marinello cited a higher figure. “We have been given preliminary estimates of around 700,000–900,000,” he said. “The provenance is impeccable. The victim’s father purchased the painting from Chagall himself. There is a significant exhibition history as well.” Regardless of the painting’s monetary value, its recovery after three decades remains a major accomplishment. “I was just blown away that 30 years after a crime occurred in New York that FBI agents were looking for this property in DC and doing the hard work to track down who the proper owners were and get it back to them,” said Faruqui. “Now it’s going to a charity, and it speaks really highly of the bureau. It’s a real feel good story!” Follow artnet News on Facebook: ||||| NEW YORK -- A lifetime art collection worth about 600,000, including a 1911 Marc Chagall painting, was taken from a wired Manhattan apartment, one of the octogenarian occupants said Thursday. 'We can't understand how they got in and how they got out without being detected,' Ernest Heller, 85, a retired jeweler, said of the burglary of his apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side. 'We have a security system here that signals how and when people enter,' he said. 'They must have known how to turn it off.' Heller and his 88-year-old wife, who only goes by the nickname, 'Red,' had returned to their apartment about 11 p.m. Wednesday from their annual two-month vacation in Aspen, Colo., when they discovered the burglary. He said detectives rushed to the apartment and stayed until 2 a.m. collecting fingerprints. The investigation continued Thursday and no determination was made on how the burglary was pulled off, said police Sgt. John Clifford. 'We have no idea how they got into the apartment. There were no apparent signs of a break-in,' Clifford said. Jewelry, paintings, sculptures, silverware and carpets, valued at more than 600,000, were taken from the apartment, he said. Among the valuables taken were Steuben china, Heller said. 'It was a lifetime of collecting.' Among the paintings were those by Renoir, Chagall and Roualt, he said. 'I liked the Chagall. I liked them all, but the Chagall was a very interesting one because it was a 1911 painting.' The Chagall painting was entitled 'Othello and Desdemona,' he said. The jewelry, which was not very important, included personal items belonging to Heller's wife and his 'dinner (diamond) studs,' he said. Heller said he and his wife were very upset about the theft. 'It's all in the hands of the police.' Heller said. 'Sometimes they're (stolen paintings) returned but I doubt it.' |||||","completion":"A painting by Marc Chagall that was stolen from a New York couple's home in 1988 has been found and will be returned to the family's estate.

Movie title: I Drink Your Blood Context: The film opens on a Satanic ritual conducted by Horace Bones, the leader of a Manson-like cult. The ritual is unknowingly witnessed by Sylvia, a young girl who has been observing them from the trees. Sylvia is eventually spotted by one of the members and is dragged in front of the group. She manages to run away but is soon caught and raped by several of the cult members. The next morning, Sylvia emerges from the woods beaten and apparently raped. She is found by Mildred, the woman who runs the local bakery, and Pete, Sylvia's younger brother. They return Sylvia home to her grandfather, Doc Banner. Mildred seeks help from her boyfriend, leader of the construction crew working on the nearby dam which has bought up most of the town leaving it deserted. The cult members' van breaks down so they elect to remain in the town. They buy pies from Mildred who explains that as most of the town is deserted and awaiting demolition they can stay in any vacant building they wish. Learning of the assault on Sylvia, Doc confronts the cult but they assault him and force him to take LSD. Pete intervenes and Doc is released. Enraged by the incident, Pete takes a shotgun to get revenge but encounters a rabid dog which he shoots. He takes blood from the dog and the next morning injects it into meat pies at the bakery, and sells them to the cult members. Back at their house, Horace and the others eat the meat pies. The others begin to show signs of infection, and eventually they lapse into animalistic behavior. The infected members then proceed to attack and kill each other in a feral rage. One of the female members of the group, Molly becomes terrified and rushes off into the night. Construction workers sent there by Mildred's boyfriend find Molly and take her with them.

We say we're \\"in the pink\\" when we are in good health. It is easy to understand how this expression was born. When my face has a nice fresh, pink colour, it is a sign which shows my health is good. The colour green is natural for trees, it is an unnatural colour for humans. When someone doesn't feel well, for example, we say he looks green. When someone is angry because he doesn't have what someone else has, we say he is \\"green with envy\\". Some people are \\"green with envy\\" because someone else has more dollars, or \\"greenbacks\\". Dollars are called \\"greenback\\" because that's the colour of the backside of the money. Blue is a cool colour. The traditional blue music of American blacks is the opposite of red hot music. It is slow, sad and soulful . To be blue, of course, is to be sad. The colour black is often used in expressions. People describe a day in which everything goes wrong as a \\"black day\\". A \\"black sheep\\" is the member of a family or group who always seems to be in trouble. If someone meets a \\"black cat\\", something unlucky might happen to him.

Throughout the write-up, the reviewer expresses dissatisfaction and critiques multiple aspects of the movie. When analyzing deeper, we can discern certain aspects that the reviewer particularly dislikes. The first is the believability of the plot and setting, as they stated \\"Very improbable orphanage on Bala\\" indicating that they found it unrealistic. They also specifically criticize certain actors' performances citing that \\"Fulton MacKay was far better in Fraggle Rock, Keith Barron was better in anything else and Diana Dors did what she did best\\" indicating that they were unimpressed with the performances, believing the actors have executed much better work in other projects. However, there are mixed sentiments as well, demonstrated in the appreciation for specific elements of the film.

Article: When you were young, ginger ale may have been a popular choice for reducing the unpleasant feelings caused by your upset stomach on the road to get to school. For years, ginger has been used to reduce the effects of nausea . But do you know it's now also being looked at to fight cancer? Scientists have discovered that ginger can kill cancerous cells in two different ways. On the one hand, ginger causes the cancer cells to \\"commit suicide\\" by destroying themselves while leaving the surrounding healthy cells untouched. Ginger can prevent the growth of diseased cells by destroying the environment they grow in. On the other hand, ginger tricks the diseased cells and causes them to fight among themselves. Researchers are now looking into one of the toughest cancers to fight. However, scientists find repeated treatment of disease by drugs can actually lose its effectiveness over time as the cancer builds up resistance to the same treatment. This raises researchers' confidence that ginger would help stop resistance from the cancer. In a study, the cancer clearly stopped growing in the body of the mice that had been given ginger. The bad news is that such encouraging research has only been conducted on mice. The good news, however, is that it seems humans might be able to get the same benefit just by eating products with ginger and ginger root in them. Cancer prevention and fighting abilities aren't the only potential benefits you may get from adding a bit more ginger to your diet. Drinking ginger ale when your stomach was upset as a child wasn't just a placebo .Numerous studies and research, including the Mayo Clinic's strict grading system, agree that ginger has some sort of anti-nausea characteristics. Some believe that ginger works well against nausea after operations, while others use it to reduce motion sickness such as seasickness and car sickness. The Mayo Clinic, however, advises the use of ginger only to reduce nausea during pregnancy. While more research needs to be done, early studies are very promising,... Question: Why do scientists think ginger can be used to fight against cancer? - Ginger can destroy diseased cells in two different ways. - Ginger is commonly considered as a kind of pain killer. - Ginger warms people's bodies and helps them recover from operations. - Ginger has no harmful side effects according to a large amount of medical research.

What might be the first step of the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The first step of the process outlined is the cooling of magma. Magma is essentially molten rock found beneath the Earth's surface. It is formed when the temperature and pressure within the Earth's mantle cause the solid rock to melt. This molten material is called magma, and it is primarily composed of silicate minerals containing varying amounts of dissolved gases, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other volatile compounds. The formation and movement of magma are closely related to the movement of tectonic plates and volcanic activity. Once magma has been generated beneath the Earth's surface, it may either rise towards the surface due to buoyancy forces or cool and crystallize within the crust itself. As the magma cools down, the minerals within it begin to solidify and form crystals. The rate at which the magma cools has a significant impact on the texture and composition of the resulting igneous rock. Faster cooling results in the formation of fine-grained rocks with small crystals, whereas slower cooling allows for the development of coarser-grained rocks with larger crystals. After the igneous rock has been formed, various external forces, such as weathering, erosion, and transport, break down the solid rock into smaller fragments or sediments. These sediments can be deposited in various environments, such as rivers, lakes, and oceans, where they eventually become compacted and cemented together to form sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks can contain valuable information about past environments, as they may preserve fossils or other clues about the conditions under which they were formed. Over time, these sedimentary rocks may be subjected to significant heat and/or pressure due to the ongoing movement of tectonic plates. Such activity may result in the transformation of sedimentary rocks into metamorphic rocks, which have a distinctly different texture and mineral composition compared to their sedimentary precursors. The intensity and duration of heat and pressure to which these rocks are exposed determine the extent of metamorphism they undergo. Finally, under sufficient heat and pressure, metamorphic rocks may begin to melt, returning once again to a molten state and completing the rock cycle. This process highlights the dynamic nature of the Earth's lithosphere and demonstrates how rocks are continuously being formed, altered, and recycled over time. In summary, the first step in the process described is the cooling of magma, leading to the formation of igneous rocks. This serves as the starting point for the rock cycle, which encompasses the various stages of rock formation, modification, and recycling that occur within the Earth's crust."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is an organic material, a natural composite of cellulose fibers which are strong in tension embedded in a matrix of lignin which resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees, or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs. In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves, other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber. - A roof is part of a building envelope. It is the covering on the uppermost part of a building or shelter which provides protection from animals and weather, notably rain or snow, but also heat, wind and sunlight. The word also denotes the framing or structure which supports that covering. - Essex County is a county in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Massachusetts. As of the 2010 census, the population was 743,159, making it the third-most populous county in Massachusetts.

Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade. - A chimney is a structure that provides ventilation for hot flue gases or smoke from a boiler, stove, furnace or fireplace to the outside atmosphere. Chimneys are typically vertical, or as near as possible to vertical, to ensure that the gases flow smoothly, drawing air into the combustion in what is known as the stack, or chimney, effect. The space inside a chimney is called a \\"flue\\". Chimneys may be found in buildings, steam locomotives and ships. In the United States, the term smokestack (colloquially, stack) is also used when referring to locomotive chimneys or ship chimneys, and the term funnel can also be used. - The Massachusetts Turnpike (locally called the Mass Pike or the Pike) is a toll road in Massachusetts, maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT). Spanning , the highway constitutes the easternmost portion of Interstate 90 (I-90); it begins near Logan International Airport at the eastern border of Boston and becomes part of the New York State Thruway at the Berkshire Connector in Canaan, New York, where I-90 continues towards its western terminus in Seattle, Washington. The turnpike traverses the state, and connects Boston with the major cities of Springfield and Worcester. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - A saltbox house is a traditional New England style of house with a long, pitched roof that slopes down to the back, generally a wooden frame house. A saltbox has just one story in the back and two stories in the front. The flat front and central chimney are recognizable features, but the asymmetry of the unequal sides and the long, low rear roof line are the most distinctive features of a saltbox, which takes its name from its resemblance to a wooden lidded box in which salt was once kept.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Mike is studying for his physics exam. He realizes that the best way to learn physics is to solve problems. To that end, he needs to to convert pressure of objects from one unit to another. In one problem, four scenarios are given for the same object, scenario A, scenario B, scenario C, and scenario D. In scenario A the pressure is given in Pascals. In scenario B the pressure is given in the atm. In scenario C the pressure is given in torr. Lastly, in scenario D the pressure is given in psi. But I can use this background: Pressures are given in a multitude of units. We've already discussed Pascals, and we know that another unit for pressure is the atmosphere (1 atm = 101.3 x 10 5 Pa). The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm. For that reason, torr is also commonly referred to as \\"millimeters mercury.\\" Another pressure unit commonly used in our everyday world is psi, or pounds per square inch, though neither psi nor torr are SI units. What is an answer for this question: Which scenario's unit would most likely be used in everyday world, scenario A or scenario D? The answer is:","completion":"Scenario D would most likely be used in everyday world because it deals with the pressure unit psi (pounds per square inch). Unlike Pascals, which are used primarily in scientific and engineering contexts, psi is commonly used for pressure measurements in everyday situations, such as tire pressure, air pressure in sports balls, and water pressure in household plumbing systems. While Pascals are the SI (International System of Units) unit for pressure and are more precise for scientific calculations, most people do not encounter them regularly in their daily lives. Scenario A, which deals with pressure in Pascals, would be less likely to be used in everyday scenarios. On the other hand, scenario D, which involves pressure in psi, would be more relatable and comprehensible for most people, making it more likely to be encountered in everyday life. Although neither psi nor torr (from scenario C) are SI units, they serve as practical and convenient pressure units for non-scientific applications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fact 2: Cottonwoods are dormant during the fall. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What happens to cottonwoods when the days get shorter?\\" with the following options: - They bloom - They go dormant - Dehydration - It helps them survive - Exfoliation - They die - They reproduce - They may not survive. Answer:","completion":"When the days get shorter, cottonwoods go dormant. This is a natural response observed in many plants, including cottonwoods, as they adapt to changing environmental conditions each season. Dormancy is a period of reduced metabolic activity that allows the plant to conserve energy during times when it may be less favorable for growth and reproduction, such as during the colder temperature and shorter days in the fall and winter months. Several factors contribute to the dormancy of cottonwoods. As daylight becomes less available, the trees receive fewer signals from the sun which trigger growth and various physiological processes. Additionally, the temperature drop in the fall months causes a slowing of metabolic reactions within the plant. These factors, combined with the diminishing availability of water due to the colder temperatures, create conditions that are less conducive to growth and reproduction. Dormancy provides cottonwoods and other plants with the ability to survive through harsh conditions until more favorable weather returns in the spring. During dormancy, the metabolic activities within the plant are greatly reduced, allowing it to survive on the limited resources it has stored during the previous growing season. This pause in growth and reproduction ensures that the plant conserves energy, which will then be available for the tree to resume active growth once the longer days and warmer temperatures return. In conclusion, when the days get shorter, cottonwoods go dormant as a response to the changing environmental conditions. This process helps the trees to conserve energy and better manage scarce resources, ensuring their survival until favorable conditions return in the spring."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Although critics have blamed Napoleon for several tactical mistakes preceding the battle, they have also praised his audacity for selecting a risky campaign strategy, choosing to invade the Italian peninsula from the north when the vast majority of French invasions came from the west, near or along the coastline. As Chandler points out, Napoleon spent almost a year getting the Austrians out of Italy in his first campaign; in 1800, it took him only a month to achieve the same goal.

Attorneys... (Associated Press) The fatal shooting of Jones, 55, and 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier, a college student visiting his father for the holiday, at a West Side home has raised further questions about a police department already under intense scrutiny. Grieving relatives and friends of the two victims gathered Sunday to remember them and criticize city officials who they said had once again failed residents. The shooting happened early Saturday morning at the small two-story home, where Jones lived in a ground-floor apartment and LeGrier's father in an upstairs unit. Police, who were responding to a 911 call made by LeGrier's father after an argument with his son, have released few details beyond a brief statement. It said that officers \\"were confronted by a combative subject resulting in the discharging of the officer's weapon\\" and added that Jones \\"was accidentally struck.\\" Both Jones and LeGrief were black, and their deaths come amid scrutiny of police after a series of deaths of African-Americans at the hands of officers across the country gave rise to the Black Lives Matter movement. It also comes amid a federal civil rights investigation into the Chicago Police Department that was launched after last month's release of police dashcam video showing white officer Jason Van Dyke shooting black 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times in 2014. Police did not disclose the race of the officer or officers, saying only that those involved will be placed on administrative duties. LeGrier's mother, Janet Cooksey, during a vigil Sunday placed candles on the porch of the home. On either side of the door, Post-It notes indicated where two bullets hit siding on the house. \\"I used to watch the news daily and I would grieve for other mothers, other family members, and now today I'm grieving myself,\\" Cooksey said at a news conference outside the residence earlier Sunday. Others who spoke said police should have used stun guns or other nonlethal methods if they felt they needed to subdue LeGrier. \\"Why do (police) have to shoot first and ask questions later?\\" Jacqueline Walker, a friend of Jones, asked. \\"It's ridiculous.\\" Family spokesman Eric Russell said Jones' many grandchildren had hoped to thank her for their Christmas gifts over the weekend. Autopsy findings released Sunday by the Cook County medical examiner's office say Jones died from a gunshot to the chest and LeGrier from multiple gunshot wounds. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi on Sunday said only that the shootings are being investigated by the city's Independent Police Review Authority, the main police oversight agency. LeGrier's cousin, Albert Person, said LeGrier's father had invited his son to a holiday gathering at another home on Christmas. Person said the son's refusal to go caused friction, but he downplayed the severity of the argument. \\"What family doesn't fight on the holidays?\\" he said. LeGrier's father, Antonio LeGrier, told the Chicago Sun-Times his son appeared to be a \\"little agitated\\" when the father returned to the apartment. Around 4:15 a.m., the elder LeGrier said he heard loud banging on his locked bedroom door and that his son said, \\"You're not going to scare me.\\" He said his son tried to bust the door open, but he kept him from doing so and called police. He added that he called Jones on the floor below to say his son was a \\"little irate\\" and not to open the door unless police arrived. He said Jones told him his son was outside with a baseball bat. Person said the teen was back in the house by the time police arrived. When they did arrive, Antonio LeGrier said he heard Jones yell, \\"Whoa, whoa, whoa!\\" He said he heard gunshots as he made his way down from the second floor and then saw his son and Jones lying in the foyer. He said his son had emotional problems after spending most of his childhood in foster care. He described him as a \\"whiz kid\\" on break from Northern Illinois University, where he majored in electrical engineering technology. Cooksey denied that her son ever exhibited \\"combative behavior.\\" She said he \\"might've been angry with his father and they might've got into it,\\" but that he was not angry or violent. It's not clear whether Jones tried to intervene before being shot or if she was hit by gunfire while answering the door. Sam Adam Jr., a lawyer for the Jones family, said Jones and LeGrier were apparently shot near the doorway of the home, but that shell casings were found some 20 feet away. He said that raised questions about whether police could have perceived LeGrier as a threat at such a distance. It couldn't be independently verified that the casings had any link to Saturday's shooting. Adam also said police took the hard drive of a home-security camera from across the street, but it was unknown if it or other cameras in the neighborhood captured the shootings. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's office said in a statement Saturday that IPRA would share its evidence with the county prosecutor's office. \\"Anytime an officer uses force the public deserves answers, and regardless of the circumstances, we all grieve anytime there is a loss of life in our city,\\" Emanuel said in the statement. ||||| As questions grow about a police-involved shooting where a 55-year-old bystander was killed, the City of Chicago announced what the mayor’s office called “two significant policy steps,” related to police shootings and procedures for interceding in domestic violence situations. NBC 5's Phil Rogers reports. (Published Monday, Dec 28, 2015) As questions grow about a police-involved shooting where a 55-year-old bystander was killed, the City of Chicago announced what the mayor’s office called “two significant policy steps,” related to police shootings and procedures for interceding in domestic violence situations. Saturday morning, 55-year-old Bettie Jones was shot and killed in a flurry of gunfire directed at a 19-year-old-man armed with a baseball bat at a two story home on Chicago’s west side. That man, Quentonio LeGrier, also died, shot seven times. “She didn’t do anything to nobody,” said Jones’ daughter Latisha. “All she did was answer her front door!” Chicago Police have given few details about the incident, saying that the officers were responding to a 911 call made by LeGrier’s father, after an argument with his son. Police said in a statement, that arriving officers were confronted by a “combative subject resulting in the discharging of the officer’s weapon,” and that “the female victim was accidentally struck.” “I feel like I just want to wake up and have my mom say, ‘Girl, that was a dream,’” said Jones daughter Latarsha. “But I can’t. She’s gone. She was murdered.” Effective immediately, the city says officers involved in shootings will be removed from street duty for a minimum of 30 days while those shootings are investigated. “I was really pleased to see that,” said Sharon Fairley, the acting chief of the Independent Police Review Authority, the agency responsible for investigating police shootings. “I definitely think that’s a step in the right direction.” Fairley acknowledged public dissatisfaction with the length of time many police shooting investigations can take. But she defended her agency’s work, saying it was most important that those investigations were done correctly. “These matters are always serious,” she said. “These investigations can be extremely complex, and there can be valid reasons that they can be extended in time.” At the same time, Fairly acknowledged that she is stepping into leadership at IPRA, at a time when public outrage over police shootings may be at an all-time high. “It’s a lot of pressure, there’s no question,” she said. “Stepping into this job at this time in this firestorm, it certainly isn’t easy. But I have to put all that aside and focus on the work and getting the work done.” Attorney Sam Adam Jr., who represents Jones’ family, questioned why it was necessary for police to fire at a subject armed only with a baseball bat. “The shell casings, many of them, are found down by the street on the sidewalk, which would suggest that is at least 25 feet away,” Adam said. In an obvious reference to the domestic investigation where the two were shot early Saturday morning, the mayor’s office announced in a statement Monday that the city would embark on a complete review of crisis intervention policies. “The Mayor has called on them to determine the deficiencies in the current training or policies,” that statement said, “and outline what steps can be taken immediately to address them.” Emanuel’s office announced Monday he was cutting a Cuban vacation short, to return to Chicago and manage the latest crisis confronting his Police Department. Fairley would not comment specifically about the investigation into the Saturday morning shootings, emphasizing instead, that she has embarked in a top to bottom review of her agency and its investigations into allegations of police wrongdoing. “I’m not about finger pointing,” she said. “What I’m focused on, is how are we going to fix it? What are the policies and procedures and training that we can put in place, to get the ship going in the right direction?” ||||| A definitive statement from the Chicago Police Department about an officer's fatal shooting of two people — one by accident — came Saturday night, 16 hours after the incident. But when it did arrive, the comments from interim Superintendent John Escalante were notable. In the late-evening press release, Escalante not only announced a major policy shift on returning officers to duty after a shooting, he also took the unusual step to acknowledge that an innocent victim had been hit by an errant police bullet. \\"The 55-year-old female victim was accidentally struck and tragically killed,\\" the statement read. \\"The department extends its deepest condolences to the victim's family and friends.\\" In contrast, the 2012 department statement on the fatal shooting of 22-year-old Rekia Boyd, who was also an unintended target of a police shooting, simply noted that a female had \\"sustained a gunshot wound.\\" Both the policy announcement and Escalante's condolences reflect the emerging reality for the Chicago Police Department in the wake of last month's release of video of a white police officer fatally shooting an African-American teen. The disturbing 2014 dash-cam video showed 17-year-old Laquan McDonald carrying a pocket knife and walking away from Officer Jason Van Dyke, who shot 16 rounds at the teen within seconds of arriving at the scene and now faces first-degree murder charges. The video, which was released only after a judge's order, has led to swift — even dizzying — changes. The U.S. Justice Department has launched a civil rights investigation into excessive force. Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy was fired, and the head of the independent agency that investigates allegations of police misconduct was forced out. Mayor Rahm Emanuel publicly apologized. The shooting about 4:30 a.m. Saturday in the 4700 block of West Erie Street was the department's first lethal use of force since the McDonald video was released, providing a glimpse of how it is responding to the biggest crisis of Emanuel's tenure in office. Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Sunday that Escalante and his command staff had started working on the policy change a week and a half ago. But in the wake of learning details from the West Side shooting, Escalante insisted the statement acknowledge the accidental killing of Bettie Jones, Guglielmi said. Chicago police fatally shot Quintonio LeGrier, 19, and Bettie Jones, 55, as officers responded to a domestic disturbance at a West Garfield Park residence Dec. 26, 2015, authorities said. \\"It was a tragic loss of life. The superintendent was adamant that the department express our deepest condolences,\\" Guglielmi said. \\"... The climate we are in is causing us to look at this. We are really trying to make the department better.\\" In the Saturday shooting on Erie, Harrison District officers were responding to a domestic violence call of a man wielding a bat. Police shot and killed Quintonio LeGrier, a 19-year-old engineering student, after he became combative with them, the Chicago police statement said. During the altercation, Bettie Jones, 55, a mother of five who lived downstairs from LeGrier's father, was shot and killed by accident. Hours after the West Side incident, Chicago police were involved in yet another shooting, though this one nonfatal. At 1:30 p.m. in the 1000 block of West 103rd Place, officers confronted a man with a gun, leading one officer to open fire, wounding the man. Such confrontations with the public are the focus of the Justice Department civil rights investigation, which was announced earlier this month by U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The probe will include a detailed examination of how and when officers use force in the department, as well as how the city investigates the incidents. The investigation was prompted by the McDonald shooting but comes after years of civil lawsuits against the department and outcries from the public over police-involved shootings. The review is expected to be lengthy, taking at least a year, and will likely lead to a court-enforced consent decree demanding systemic reforms. Recommended changes could cover anything from training to how firearm discharges are recorded and documented in the department. But Chicago doesn't have to wait for the Justice Department review to address problems, and Escalante has already made some moves aimed at restoring public confidence. Soon after Escalante took over as interim superintendent, he announced a policy change on dashboard cameras. Because there was missing audio in the dashboard cameras from responding vehicles the night of McDonald's shooting, Escalante has sent out inspectors on random checks to see if the dash cams are working property. If an inspector finds that an officer didn't tell a supervisor about a faulty camera, that officer could be disciplined. Then on Saturday night, the interim superintendent announced another policy change: Officers involved in shootings will be shifted to mandatory administrative duty, returning to their assigned bureau for desk duty for 30 days. The new policy includes the officer or officers involved in Saturday's shooting, according to the police statement. That is a big shift from the current policy in which officers generally had three days to see a counselor and be cleared for return to duty unless it was determined that they need more time off. Officers were also required to report for a one-day retraining at the academy — though that could happen after they returned to duty. During the newly established 30-day period, the officer will be required to attend the training class at the academy, commanding officers will monitor and evaluate if the officer is prepared to return to street duties, and the officer will have to see a department counselor. Guglielmi said Escalante reviewed other cities' departments and settled on the 30 days because \\"it seemed like a fair amount of time to get all those objectives done.\\" Providing officers with time off following a shooting is not unusual. It is considered essential to making sure an officer is coping with any psychological issues in the aftermath of the incident and is getting whatever support he or she needs. Getting the proper help for officers is not an easy task in a profession where admitting weakness has historically been frowned upon. ||||| Tensions remain high in Chicago after police shot and killed two people early Saturday morning, with the force already faces heightened scrutiny overs its practices. Janet Cooksey says her 19-year-old son, Quintonio LeGrier, was a college honors student studying engineering who recently had been dealing with some mental health issues, reports CBS News correspondent Anna Werner. Family members reportedly called police to their home Saturday because the teen was threatening his father with a baseball bat. Detectives described LeGrier as being \\"combative\\" before he was shot. \\"I used to watch the news daily and I would grieve for other mothers, other family members, and now today I'm grieving myself,\\" said Janet Cooksey, LeGrier's mother. \\"When do it come to an end?\\" Fifty-five-year-old Bettie Jones, a mother of five, lived in the same building. She was reportedly waiting for police to respond, then got shot along with LeGrier. Police admitted she was quote \\"accidentally struck and tragically killed.\\" \\"Right now is a time for compassion towards the suffering of families that are experiencing injustices throughout our city,\\" Jahmal Cole, a Jones relative, said Sunday at a press conference. The frustration felt by this community comes amid protests over a string of deadly police shootings. Video released recently showed the death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, shot by officer Jason Van Dyke 16 times in October of 2014. The officer faces criminal charges. On Sunday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel called for a review of how police are trained to respond to mental health issues in a crisis. But family, friends and local religious leaders holding a vigil for LeGrier and Jones were critical of Emanuel's efforts - some now even asking for intervention from the White House. \\"We hope to hear from the president, President Obama -- we are under siege,\\" said Pastor Ira Acree of the Greater St. John Bible Church. This incident was one of two separate police-involved shooting incidents Saturday. Chicago's independent police review board is investigating both, while the Justice Department continues to investigate whether the Chicago police use excessive force appropriately. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Chicago police are under intense scrutiny following the fatal shooting of 55-year-old Bettie Jones and 19-year-old college student, Quintonio LeGrier, during a domestic disturbance on 26 December. Both victims were black and the incident has further fuelled the debate around the conduct of police officers and the Chicago Police Department, which is already under a federal civil rights investigation. Questions are now being raised over why the police did not use non-lethal methods in their confrontation with LeGrier, and why they felt they needed to shoot in the first place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Why is the sky sometimes very bright at night in the winter? Why sometimes at night sky looks brown in colour? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"1. Why is the sky sometimes very bright at night in the winter? The sky can be very bright at night during the winter for several reasons, including: A. Snow cover: In the winter, snow may be covering the ground. Snow is highly reflective, meaning that it effectively reflects and scatters sunlight and artificial light from the surroundings. When sunlight bounces off the snow and back into the sky, it can create a brighter night sky. B. Shorter days and longer nights: In winter, days are shorter because the Earth is tilted away from the sun at a sharper angle. This means that nights are longer in winter, giving our eyes more time to adapt to the low levels of light. Due to dark adaptation, our eyes become more sensitive in the darkness, which can make even small amounts of light appear brighter. C. Light pollution: Light pollution is the excessive or misdirected artificial light from streetlights, buildings, and other sources. During winter nights, since people tend go indoors earlier, more artificial lights are turned on, increasing the light pollution. This additional light can also contribute to the brightness of the night sky. D. Atmospheric conditions: Clear and cold winter nights often provide the best conditions for light to travel without being scattered by particles in the atmosphere. This increased atmospheric clarity can make the night sky seem brighter because both natural and artificial light sources can appear more intense. 2. Why sometimes at night sky looks brown in colour? The night sky may appear brown in color due to factors such as: A. Light pollution: Light pollution from artificial sources like streetlights, outdoor signs, and buildings can make the sky appear brown. This is because the artificial light is typically orange-yellow in color and, when it disperses into the atmosphere, it creates a brownish or reddish hue. B. Air pollution and particulates: Air pollution from aerosols, dust, and smoke scattering light can produce a brownish hue in the night sky. These pollutants absorb and scatter light in a way that can make the sky look brown. C. Color perception: The human eye is more sensitive to certain colors (like green and red) than to others (like blue) under low-light conditions. Consequently, when observing the night sky, this color sensitivity, combined with light pollution and air pollution, can cause the sky to appear brown or reddish. 3. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? No, these questions are not paraphrases of each other. While both questions pertain to the appearance and color of the night sky, they address different phenomena. The first question explores why the sky may appear brighter at night during winter, considering factors such as snow cover, shorter days and longer nights, light pollution, and atmospheric conditions. The second question seeks to understand why the night sky may appear brown, focusing on light pollution, air pollution, and color perception. This question is more concerned with the color of the sky rather than its brightness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

However, expressing the feeling may have negative consequences in terms of straining the relationship or potentially making the boyfriend feel guilty. For action (B), it involves asking a couple to pay their \\"fair share,\\" which presumably means asking them to contribute fairly in a financial situation. This action implies that there is a sense of fairness that is not being met, and it aims to address this inequality.

Given the question: Do you think hard work can make anything possible? If you don't, you may want to read the book We Can Do written by Moshe Kai Cavalin. It might change your mind. Moshe Kai Cavalin is a 14-year-old American boy. He is about to graduate from UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) this year. Before that, he had already gotten a degree from East Los Angeles Community College in 2009. Recently, Cavalin published the book We Can Do. In this book, he talks about how to achieve things we want, by keeping yourself focused and trying your best to do everything. He says this doesn't need genius , just hard work. Cavalin says being called a genius \\"has always bothered me... People need to know they don't have to be geniuses; they just need to work hard and they can achieve anything. If I can reach the stars, others can reach the Milky Way(,).\\" The idea of writing a book came from a teacher named Richard Avila at his first college. Cavalin says Avila inspired him to write a book to explain how he succeeded, so he could inspire other people. It took Cavalin four years to finish the book. Because his mother is Chinese, she wanted to publish the book in Chinese. So Cavalin translated the book into Chinese by himself. The book did well in Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. Cavalin owes his success to the following EXCEPT that _ . A) he can focus on one thing B) he has tried his best to do things C) he was born a genius D) he worked hard at his dream The answer is:","completion":"C) he was born a genius As per the provided information, Moshe Kai Cavalin emphasizes that his achievements are not because he was born a genius, but rather they are a result of his hard work, dedication, and ability to focus on his goals.

Instead, he believes that anyone can achieve exceptional results by simply working hard and staying focused on their objectives. Cavalin's story serves as a reminder that hard work can make anything possible, as it is the driving force behind his accomplishments, such as graduating from UCLA at the age of 14, getting a degree from East Los Angeles Community College, and writing and translating his book to inspire others. In light of this, his success can indeed be attributed to his ability to focus on one thing, trying his best to do everything, and working hard at his dream.

Children kick a football around for fun. When they get older and play for local school teams, they become competitive but they still enjoy playing. The individual representing his country cannot afford to think about enjoying himself; he has to think only about winning. He is responsible for the entire nation's hopes, dreams and reputation. A good example is the football Word Cup. Football is the world's most important sport. Winning the World Cup is perhaps the summit of international sporting success. Mention Argentina to someone and the chances are that he'll think of football. In a sense, winning the World Cup put Argentina on the map. Sports fans and supporters get quite _ about the World Cup. People in England felt that their country was somehow important after they won in 1966. Last year thousands of Scots sold their cars, and even their houses, and spent all their money traveling to Argentina, where the finals were played. So, am I arguing that international competition kills the idea of sport? Certainly not!

Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \\"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647–1706) observed that in his day, \\"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself.

Q: Scientists use what scale to illustrate the order in which events on earth have happened? Choices: - ecological succession - fossil record - cataclysmic time scale - geologic time scale A: Answer:","completion":"Geologic Time Scale Based on the given paragraph, scientists use the geologic time scale to illustrate the order in which events on Earth have happened. The geologic time scale is a system of chronological measurements and dating that relates geological strata to time. It provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the sequence of events, processes, and changes that have occurred on our planet throughout its approximately 4.6 billion-year history. The geologic time scale is divided into several units called eons, eras, periods, and epochs, which help scientists study and analyze Earth's geological, biological, and climatic history more conveniently. These divisions are based on significant events, such as the appearance of different life forms, mass extinctions, and major shifts in climate. The four primary eons of the geologic time scale, from oldest to youngest, are: Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic. The Phanerozoic Eon is further subdivided into three eras: Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic. Each era is further divided into periods, such as the Cambrian Period in the Paleozoic Era or the Jurassic Period in the Mesozoic Era, and some periods are divided into epochs. Major factors that contribute to the construction of the geologic time scale include the study of rock layers and their respective stratigraphy, the analysis of fossils (which help with relative dating), and radiometric dating techniques (which allow for more accurate absolute dating). By combining these methods, scientists can create a detailed chronological map of Earth's history that includes the timing of geological events, the development and extinction of species, and the natural processes that have shaped the planet's landforms and climate. In summary, the geologic time scale serves as a key tool for scientists to understand and communicate the chronology and complex history of Earth's events. It combines a variety of methods to create a detailed and comprehensive picture of the interactions between geologic processes, the evolution of life, and changes in climate that have occurred over time. Thus, it plays a crucial role in various domains of Earth sciences, such as geology, paleontology, and climatology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

At the White House on Wednesday, Trump continued to speak cautiously about the coming summit, even while praising the North Korean leader for the prisoner release. “Everything can be scuttled,” Trump told reporters. “A lot of things can happen — a lot of good things can happen, [and] a lot of bad things can happen.” North Korea on Wednesday granted amnesty to three Americans of Korean descent. They had been accused of espionage or trying to overthrow the government, charges widely seen as bogus. Pyongyang has detained at least 16 Americans over the past two decades, often attempting to use them as bargaining chips. All were eventually released, although Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old college student, died shortly after returning to the United States last year. A White House statement Wednesday praised North Korea’s latest prisoner release as a “positive gesture of goodwill” ahead of the Trump-Kim summit, which is expected to take place as soon as next month. South Korea’s presidential office said Pyongyang’s decision was a “very positive” sign for a successful North Korea-U.S. meeting. The freeing of the prisoners coincided with a visit to Pyongyang by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who declined to say whether the release was a U.S. precondition for holding talks with the North. “I don’t know the answer to that,” Pompeo told reporters on the flight home. “It would have been more difficult [had the prisoners not been released]. ... I’m glad that we don’t have to confront that.” It’s not clear what, if anything, the U.S. gave up in exchange for the prisoners. It’s not even clear a concession was needed, since North Korea has for decades sought the presumed legitimacy provided by a summit with a sitting U.S. president. after the story ends does Pyongyang take more prisoners?

At a dinner, Nick encounters Hillary Flammond, a member of the local resistance movement, attempting to avoid the authorities.

Although it has been deemed by some as \\"a homage\\", in reality, no admiration (or even sympathy, for that matter) is declared for the Devil in the song -other than his \\"own\\" request.

It uses appropriate verb tenses (\\"became,\\" \\"making\\"), correct prepositions (\\"in,\\" \\"than,\\" \\"in\\"), the right form of the demonstrative pronoun (\\"it\\"), and is punctuated appropriately. Secondly, in terms of syntactical coherency, the sentence is logically structured and coherent. It begins with an introductory prepositional phrase about the time (\\"In January 2002\\"), it is followed by an independent clause \\"a dull star in an obscure constellation suddenly became 600,000 times more luminous than our Sun,\\" and ends with a participle phrase, which acts as an adverbial, modifying the entire preceding clause (\\"temporarily making it the brightest star in our galaxy\\"). The semantic depth and precision is appreciable too. The adjective 'dull' effectively communicates the pre-occurrence state of the star, while the adverb 'suddenly' creates a sense of sudden transformation, emphasizing the dramatic shift in brightness. The phrase '600,000 times more luminous than our Sun' stipulates a clear comparison that shows the magnanimity of the event. Finally, 'temporarily making it the brightest star in our galaxy' not only reflects the consequence of the event, but it also subtly informs that this phenomenal brightness was not permanent, indicating the transient nature of such cosmic events. As for readability, this sentence is clear, concise, and straightforward, thus it makes for easy comprehension. There are no overly complex terms, and the sentence employs an organized and logical structure. Considering stylistic efficacy, the sentence is quite effective and engaging. The choice of words such as 'dull' and 'obscure' add mood and tone to the sentence, which creates curiosity and sparks the interest of readers. Its descriptiveness pulls readers into a cosmic scenario where a seemingly unnoticeable star erupts into unmatched brightness—the narrative style therefore manages to convey impressiveness of the event. In conclusion, when we consider the linguistic integrity of the given sentence, it is safe to say that it is a well-formed, meaningful, clear, and stylistically impressive sentence. It demonstrates a high degree of competence in language usage, maintaining a balance between scientific conceptual clarity and narrative engagement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer:","completion":"Yes, Shipping News and Gene are both rock bands, although they belong to different subgenres and have distinct musical styles, backgrounds, and timeframes within the rock music spectrum. Shipping News is an American post-rock band founded in 1996. The band finds its roots in Louisville, Kentucky, and is comprised of members Jeff Mueller (guitar, vocals), Jason Noble (guitar, vocals), Todd Cook (bass), and Kyle Crabtree (drums). Shipping News is associated with the '90s and early 2000s post-rock movement, which is characterized by the use of rock instrumentation to create expansive, atmospheric, and experimental soundscapes that often deviate from the traditional verse-chorus structure of popular rock songs. The band's music is influenced by the styles of post-rock pioneers such as Slint, Rodan, and June of 44. Shipping News has released several albums and EPs, including \\"Save Everything\\" (1997), \\"Very Soon, and in Pleasant Company\\" (2001), \\"Flies the Fields\\" (2005), and \\"One Less Heartless to Fear\\" (2010). Though their popularity may not have reached mainstream levels, the band is well-respected within the realm of post-rock and experimental music enthusiasts. On the other hand, Gene is a British indie rock band that emerged in the early '90s, with a sound often compared to that of The Smiths and elements of Britpop. Formed in London in 1993, the band's members consisted of Martin Rossiter (vocals), Steve Mason (guitar), Kevin Miles (bass), and Matt James (drums). Their debut album, \\"Olympian\\" (1995), received critical acclaim for its melodic songs and introspective lyrics, which resonated with a generation of young indie rock fans. Gene released a series of successful albums during the '90s and early 2000s, including \\"Drawn to the Deep End\\" (1997) and \\"Revelations\\" (1999). They enjoyed widespread popularity in the UK during their peak years, with several charting singles and albums. Ultimately, Gene disbanded in 2004, but their music continues to have a lasting influence on the British indie rock scene. In conclusion, Shipping News and Gene are both rock bands, but with different subgenres, musical styles, origins, and timeframes. Shipping News represents the experimental and atmospheric side of post-rock in the American context, while Gene embodies the melodic, introspective essence of British indie rock with some Britpop influence. Both bands have left their mark on the rock music landscape, though they appeal to different niches within the broader rock genre."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students.

Plot title: The Damned United Movie plot: After failing to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey is replaced by Don Revie (Colm Meaney), the highly successful manager of Leeds United. Revie's replacement at Leeds is Brian Clough (Michael Sheen), the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds, because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), has not joined him. The roots of Clough's conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, the leaders of the First Division[3] and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 2â0.[4] Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay (Brian McCardie), along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson (Jim Broadbent) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted. They once again face Leeds, only to lose 5â0. The club win their first ever League championship in 1972, meaning a European Cup campaign the following year. They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus. Unfortunately, against Longson's advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie.

Which US state in 1907 was the last to declare Christmas a legal holiday? What is the answer?","completion":"Oklahoma was the last US state to declare Christmas a legal holiday in 1907. Christmas was not always universally celebrated across the United States; in fact, many early American settlers had mixed views on the holiday. This was primarily due to the diverse range of religious beliefs held by immigrants arriving in the New World. During the 17th and 18th centuries, certain religious groups in the United States, such as the Puritans, regarded the celebration of Christmas as a decadent and unnecessary custom. In some parts of the country, particularly in New England, Christmas was banned and not observed as a public holiday. It wasn't until the 19th century that Christmas became more widely accepted and adopted in the United States. Over time, the popularity of Christmas grew, and many states started to declare it as a legal holiday. The first state to do so was Alabama in 1836. Slowly, other states followed suit. Oklahoma became the last state to recognize Christmas as a legal holiday in 1907, shortly after it achieved statehood on November 16 of the same year. The shift in public opinion towards the celebration of Christmas can be attributed to various factors. One significant influence was the influx of immigrants from Europe, who brought their Christmas customs and traditions with them. Additionally, the works of authors like Charles Dickens, particularly his famous tale, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" (published in 1843), contributed towards shaping the modern image of Christmas, with a focus on family gatherings, goodwill, and generosity. Publications such as Clement Clarke Moore's \\"A Visit from St. Nicholas\\" (also known as \\"The Night Before Christmas\\") and the illustrations by Thomas Nast also played a significant role in popularizing Christmas customs, including the image of Santa Claus. By the beginning of the 20th century, Christmas had evolved into a major cultural event in the United States, embraced by a large majority of the population. Today, Christmas is a federal holiday in the United States, celebrated by millions of people every year, regardless of their religious affiliations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Q: What is the lipid-rich sheath that surrounds the axon and facilitates the transmission of electrical signals along the axon? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Myelin The insulation for axons in the nervous system is provided by glial cells, oligodendrocytes in the CNS, and Schwann cells in the PNS. Whereas the manner in which either cell is associated with the axon segment, or segments, that it insulates is different, the means of myelinating an axon segment is mostly the same in the two situations. Myelin is a lipid-rich sheath that surrounds the axon and by doing so creates a myelin sheath that facilitates the transmission of electrical signals along the axon. The lipids are essentially the phospholipids of the glial cell membrane. Myelin, however, is more than just the membrane of the glial cell. It also includes important proteins that are integral to that membrane. Some of the proteins help to hold the layers of the glial cell membrane closely together. The appearance of the myelin sheath can be thought of as similar to the pastry wrapped around a hot dog for “pigs in a blanket” or a similar food. The glial cell is wrapped around the axon several times with little to no cytoplasm between the glial cell layers. For oligodendrocytes, the rest of the cell is separate from the myelin sheath as a cell process extends back toward the cell body. A few other processes provide the same insulation for other axon segments in the area. For Schwann cells, the outermost layer of the cell membrane contains cytoplasm and the nucleus of the cell as a bulge on one side of the myelin sheath. During development, the glial cell is loosely or incompletely wrapped around the axon (Figure 12.13a). The edges of this loose enclosure extend toward each other, and one end tucks under the other. The inner edge wraps around the axon, creating several layers, and the other edge closes around the outside so that the axon is completely enclosed.

Anaheim is the second largest city in Orange County in terms of land area (after Irvine) and is known for its theme parks, sports teams, and convention center. - In baseball, the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher's mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1. The pitcher is often considered the most important defensive player, and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum. There are many different types of pitchers, such as the starting pitcher, relief pitcher, middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and closer. - In baseball and softball, a relief pitcher or reliever is a pitcher who enters the game after the starting pitcher is removed due to injury, ineffectiveness, fatigue, ejection, or for other strategic reasons, such as being substituted by a pinch hitter. Relief pitchers are further divided informally into various roles, such as closers, set-up relief pitchers, middle relief pitchers, left/right-handed specialists, and long relievers. Whereas starting pitchers usually rest several days before pitching in a game again due to the number of pitches thrown, relief pitchers are expected to be more flexible and typically pitch more games but with fewer innings pitched. A team's staff of relievers is normally referred to metonymically as a team's bullpen, which refers to the area where the relievers sit during games, and where they warm-up prior to entering the game. - Lori Harrigan - Mack ( born September 5 , 1970 ) is an American , former collegiate All - American , right - handed hitting , left - handed softball pitcher originally from Anaheim , California . She was a three - time Olympic Champion as a member of the Team USA winning in 1996 , 2000 and 2004 . Harrigan played collegiately from 1989 -- 1992 at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas where she owns numerous records ; she is the Big West career leader in shutouts and innings pitched . - Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding. - The International Softball Federation is the international governing body for the sport of softball. The ISF is a non-profit corporation recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and SportAccord (formerly the General Association of International Sports Federations). - In baseball (hardball or softball), a starting pitcher or starter is the first pitcher in the game for each team. A pitcher is credited with a game started if they throw the first pitch to the opponent's first batter of a game. A pitcher who enters the game after the first pitch of the game is a relief pitcher. Starting pitchers are expected to pitch for a significant portion of the game, although their ability to do this depends on many factors, including effectiveness, stamina, health, and strategy. - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S. - Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player. When a batter takes his/her turn to hit, the catcher crouches behind home plate, in front of the (home) umpire, and receives the ball from the pitcher. In addition to this primary duty, the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well. The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket. - The 2010 United States Census, (known as \\"Census 2010\\"), is the twenty-third and currently most recent United States national census. National Census Day, the reference day used for the census, was April 1, 2010. As part of a drive to increase the count's accuracy, 635,000 temporary enumerators were hired. The population of the United States was counted as 308,745,538, a 9.7% increase from the 2000 Census. - The Amateur Softball Association (ASA) is a volunteer, non-profit organization based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It was founded in 1933 with a tournament held in Chicago that was organized by Leo Fischer and Michael J. Pauley. The following year the 1934 National Recreation Congress recognized the ASA. Shortly afterward the ASA was located in Newark, New Jersey. A world amateur softball tournament was held by the ASA at Chicago's Soldier Field that started on September 7, 1939. The ASA moved to Oklahoma City on January 1, 1966. - In baseball, innings pitched (IP) are the number of innings a pitcher has completed, measured by the number of batters and baserunners that are put out while the pitcher is on the pitching mound in a game. Three outs made is equal to one inning pitched. One out counts as one-third of an inning, and two outs counts as two-thirds of an inning. Sometimes, the statistic is written 34.1, 72.2, or 91.0, for example, to represent innings, innings, and 91 innings exactly, respectively. - A tournament held in 1933 at the Chicago World's Fair spurred interest in the game. The Amateur Softball Association (ASA) of America (founded 1933) governs the game in the United States and sponsors annual sectional and World Series championships. The World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) regulates rules of play in more than 110 countries, including the United States and Canada; before the WBSC was formed in 2013, the International Softball Federation filled this role. Women's fastpitch softball became a Summer Olympic sport in 1996, but it (and baseball) were dropped from the 2012 Games; they will be reinstated for the 2020 Games. - An inning in baseball, softball, and similar games is the basic unit of play, consisting of two halves or frames, the \\"top\\" (first half) and the \\"bottom\\" (second half). In each half, one team bats until three outs are made, with the other team playing defense. A full game typically is scheduled for nine innings, although this may be shortened due to weather or extended in the event that the score is tied at the end of the scheduled innings.

His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and musique concrete works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. Zappa was born on December 21, 1940 in Baltimore, Maryland. His mother, Rosemarie (nee Collimore) was of Italian (Neapolitan and Sicilian) and French ancestry; his father, whose name was anglicized to Francis Vincent Zappa, was an immigrant from Partinico, Sicily, with Greek and Arab ancestry. Frank, the eldest of four children, was raised in an Italian-American household where Italian was often spoken by his grandparents. The family moved often because his father, a chemist and mathematician, worked in the defense industry. After a time in Florida in the 1940s, the family returned to Maryland, where Zappa's father worked at the Edgewood Arsenal chemical warfare facility of the Aberdeen Proving Ground. Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored mustard gas, gas masks were kept in the home in case of an accident. This had a profound effect on Zappa, and references to germs, germ warfare and the defense industry occur throughout his work. Zappa was often sick as a child, suffering from asthma, earaches and sinus problems. A doctor treated his sinusitis by inserting a pellet of radium into each of Zappa's nostrils. At the time, little was known about the potential dangers of even small amounts of therapeutic radiation, and although it has since been claimed that nasal radium treatment has causal connections to cancer, no studies have provided significant enough evidence to confirm this. Nasal imagery and references appear in his music and lyrics, as well as in the collage album covers created by his long-time collaborator Cal Schenkel. Zappa believed his childhood diseases might have been due to exposure to mustard gas, released by the nearby chemical warfare facility. His health worsened when he lived in Baltimore. In 1952, his family relocated for reasons of health. They next moved to Monterey, California, where his father taught metallurgy at the Naval Postgraduate School. They soon moved to Claremont, California, then to El Cajon, before finally settling in San Diego. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Was he raised by both of his parents?","completion":"Yes, Frank Vincent Zappa was raised by both of his parents.

The busiest woman in Labrador during one bitter cold Christmas not very long ago, was an Australian nurse named Kate Austen. But Nurse Austen was not too busy to write with a long, friendly letter for every gift of food or clothing received for poor villagers in the north of Australian. Among the gifts was a box of knittings for children, knitted and sent by a woman in Toronto. Nurse Austen, was busy, and not feeling too well that winter. She could have written just ordinary routine notes of acknowledgement. But that was not her way. She sat down and wrote the woman in Toronto a real letter telling all about the village, and the names of the children who were wearing the knitted gloves and caps, and what they said when they got them, and how they looked when they wore them. She wanted the woman who had knitted and sent all those lovely knittings \\"to see how much happiness and warmth she had created.\\" Not long after, she received the following answer from Canada. Dear Miss Austen, Your letter made me happy. I did not expect such a full return, I am eighty years old, and I am blind.

Process: - Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The resulting volcano may explode. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more gases build up under the earth happens, how will it affect MORE or GREATER eruptions. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis, in this context, involves the supposition that an increased buildup of gases beneath the Earth's surface will lead to potential changes in the volcanic eruption process. To analyze the impacts of this perturbation on the process, we can break down the volcanic eruption process into specific stages and discuss how an increase in the buildup of gases may affect each stage. 1. Gases cause pressure beneath the Earth: The primary cause of volcanic eruptions is the accumulation of molten rock (magma) beneath the Earth's surface. As a result of various geological processes, gases begin to dissolve in this magma. These gases, primarily water vapor, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and smaller quantities of other gases, contribute to the overall pressure beneath the Earth. If more gases were to build up under the Earth's surface due to increased geological activity or other factors, the pressure beneath the Earth would increase at a faster rate. 2. The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface: As the pressure caused by the dissolved gases increases, it may reach a point where it is strong enough to break through the overlying rocks. In such cases, the increased pressure from the additional buildup of gases would lead to a more significant force acting on the magma and could result in more magma being pushed towards the Earth's surface. Consequently, larger volumes of magma may rise, potentially leading to more substantial volcanic eruptions. 3. The magma cools: Once the magma reaches the surface, it cools down and starts to solidify. With more gases building up beneath the Earth's surface, larger volumes of magma may reach the surface. As a result, it might take longer for the entire volume of magma to cool and solidify, which could lead to prolonged volcanic activity or a more extensive area being covered by cooled magma deposits. 4. With enough time, the pressure builds up greatly: Over time, the buildup of pressure beneath the Earth's surface continues to increase, primarily due to the continued accumulation of gases. In the context of the perturbation hypothesis, it is likely that greater amounts of gases would lead to the pressure building up more rapidly and reaching critical levels sooner compared to a lower gas buildup situation. This accelerated buildup could lead to more frequent volcanic eruptions. 5. The resulting volcano may explode: With enough pressure, a volcano may eventually erupt explosively. The increased buildup of gases would result in higher pressures beneath the Earth's surface, leading to a more significant likelihood of explosive volcanic eruptions. Additionally, these explosions may be more forceful and release more energy due to the increased gas pressure, causing more considerable damage and more extensive lava and ash production. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of increasing gas buildup beneath the Earth's surface has the potential to directly impact the volcanic eruption process. It could lead to larger volumes of magma being pushed towards the surface, increased likelihood of explosive eruptions, and more frequent and prolonged volcanic activities. This higher rate of volcanic eruptions and the more significant impact of each eruption could have major consequences on the environment, climate, and human activities. Therefore, understanding the factors contributing to increased gas buildup and monitoring volcanic activities becomes crucial in mitigating the risks associated with such perturbations."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

It was clear he had never given serious thought to the consequences of his actions. He had always been one to walk the line between the factions, each wary of his known loyalties yet willing to work with him for their own purposes. But now, his betrayal had put him in grave danger from all sides. The Fellowship would no doubt be out for blood, thirsty for revenge upon learning that someone they once considered their own had turned against them. And it wasn't just the vampires who would want to make an example out of Hugo; their allies, the werewolves, demons, and other creatures of the night, would also seek retribution. They would want to send a message to those who dared to defy them, that treachery would not be tolerated. The air in the dimly lit room grew colder, the tension so palpable it could be cut with a knife. Hugo's once confident façade had crumbled as the reality of his situation sank in. He knew he was in too deep, that there was no turning back. \\"You must understand, Hugo, not only have you sealed your own fate, but you've also endangered the lives of those around you. The Fellowship and its allies don't discriminate when it comes to extracting vengeance. Your colleagues, your friends... even your family... they may all become targets simply because they are linked to you.\\" For a moment, it seemed as though Hugo was struggling to find a way to rationalize the chaos he had brought into his life. As a skilled manipulator, he had always found ways to navigate the supernatural underworld by playing both sides, exploiting the weaknesses and desires of others to further his own goals. But now, he was quickly running out of options, and time. \\"What you must do now, Hugo, is find a way to atone for your actions. This path of betrayal and deceit that you've trodden upon has only led to suffering and inevitable ruin. The only way to possibly save yourself and those you care about is to make amends, to right the wrongs you've committed.\\" He looked at me with both doubt and desperation, weighing his options. \\"But how? What could I possibly do to make up for the mess I've made?\\" \\"Well, you can start by severing your ties with both sides, the Fellowship and the vampires. Promise yourself never to return to the world of darkness and manipulation that you've become a part of. Then, you should seek allies from outside the shadows, those who genuinely want to bring peace and harmony between humans and supernaturals.\\" I could see the wheels turning in Hugo's mind, as he pondered my words in silence. But time was of the essence, and he needed to make a decision soon. The storm was brewing, and it would not be long before it descended upon him and everything he held dear. \\"Choose your path wisely, Hugo, for it will determine not only your fate but that of countless others. There are forces larger than yourself at play, and your actions could greatly impact the balance and the safety of our world.\\" With that, I left Hugo to ponder his next move, hoping that he would choose the path of redemption rather than continuing down that treacherous road that could all but guarantee his destruction. But in the end, the choice was his to make, and only time would reveal the true extent of the consequences his actions would bear upon our world."},{"prompt":"Question: Q: When a stalactite and stalagmite join together, they form a what?

The protests signify the growing discontent within Greece and highlight the general public's resistance to any further austerity measures that are being proposed by the government. 3. Escalation of violence during protests: The protests have turned violent, with gasoline bombs being thrown and tear gas being used to disperse the crowds. Such events have undoubtedly added to the tension and unease surrounding the confidence vote. 4. International assistance to tackle Greece's budget deficit: As Greece struggles to deal with its budget deficit, international help has been mobilized in an attempt to provide the necessary support. It is hoped that this assistance will help Greece to overcome its economic challenges and restore faith in the government's ability to manage the nation's finances. Conclusion: Thursday's confidence vote for Prime Minister George Papandreou will undoubtedly be a significant moment in the ongoing Greek political and economic crisis. With thousands of protestors taking to the streets to voice their anger against proposed austerity measures, the situation in Greece remains precarious. As violence escalates and international assistance is sought, the country's leaders will be under immense pressure to find a solution that appeases both the nation's financial needs and its population's concerns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I was told that it was impossible to do because even though we had the rolling stock, we did not have the ability to deal with a union that had the opportunity to charge double time, triple time and all kinds of things on a train that was going across the country for two or three days. Can we draw the following conclusion? Only single time can be charged.","completion":"From the information given, we cannot necessarily draw the conclusion that only single time can be charged. The statement offers multiple points to consider, so let's break it down and analyze it thoroughly. The scenario being discussed involves a train going across the country for several days. While there is the availability of rolling stock (railway vehicles like wagons or coaches), the main concern expressed is the inability to deal with the union which may charge higher rates based on specific circumstances. The statement appears to find issue with the union potentially charging double time and triple time for certain periods during the train's journey. Double time and triple time are terms referring to charging twice or three times the regular rate, respectively. These are usually applied when employees are required to work overtime, on holidays, or during weekends. These rates are meant to compensate employees for working extended hours or giving up personal time to meet business demands. It is important to note that the statement does not claim that such rates are unjustified or unreasonable; instead, the concern lies in not having the ability to deal with the expenses these union-imposed rates may incur. This suggests that the train operating company might not have the financial resources or negotiated arrangements in place to cover these increased costs. Therefore, the assumption that only single time can be charged is not entirely correct, given the context of this statement. The concern pertains to the potential for increased rates that companies may be unable to handle or negotiate, not the outright impossibility of charging double time, triple time, or other premium rates. In different situations or under different agreements, charging double time, triple time, or any other rate multiplier may very well be permissible and appropriate as part of a union labor agreement. It is also important to keep in mind that union agreements and labor laws governing work hours and pay rates can vary significantly by location and industry. What may be true for this specific train operating company may not necessarily apply universally across different organizations and contexts. So, while the statement highlights a key concern and challenge in this particular situation, the conclusion stating that only \\"single time can be charged\\" is not accurate without considering the broader context, possible alternative arrangements, or differing labor agreements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Inauguration Poster Likens Obama to Jesus Street vendors and souvenir stores across Washington, D.C. are selling posters depicting President Obama as Jesus Christ — and one national news publication called him the “Second Coming.” FOLLOW TODD ON FACEBOOK FOR CULTURE WAR NEWS. CLICK HERE! The poster, which does not have the official endorsement of the White House, features an image of the president in prayer with the headline, “Prophecy Fulfilled.” “Barak is of Hebrew origin and its meaning is ‘flash of lightning,” the poster notes, referencing a passage in in the Old Testament book of Judges. Hussein, they allege, is a Biblical word meaning “good and handsome.” “So you see, Barak was destined to be a good and handsome man that would rise like a flash of lightning to win victory in a battle against overwhelming odds,” the poster read. This week’s cover of Newsweek depicts President Obama as the “Second Coming” – a biblical reference to the return of Christ. It’s not the first time that Obama has been deified by his supporters. Actor Jamie Foxx called President Obama “our Lord and Savior” during a recent television appearance. “It’s like church over here,” Foxx told the audience. “First of all, give an honor to God and our Lord and Savior Barack Obama.” “Barack Obama,” he shouted as the audience cheered. Florida A&M professor Barbara Thompson published a book titled “The Gospel According to Apostle Barack.” The book likens Obama to Jesus Christ and Martin Luther King, Jr. “I learned that Jesus walked the earth to create a more civilized society, Martin (Luther King) walked the earth to create a more justified society, but, Apostle Barack, the name he was called in my dreams, would walk the earth to create a more equalized society, for the middle class and working poor,” she wrote in an excerpt published by The Daily Caller. “Apostle Barack, the next young leader with a new cause, had been taken to the mountaintop and allowed to see over the other side.” A controversial painting of President Obama, posed as Jesus Christ on the cross, was part of an art exhibit at Bunker Hill Community College in Boston. Photo by Art & Response The Michael D’Antuono painting is called “The Truth” — and features the president with his arms stretched out — wearing a crown of thorns. The original debut of the painting four years ago was cancelled due to public outrage, Design & Trend reported. At the time D’Antuono told Air America that he didn’t mean to “disrespect people’s religion. It’s meant as a political piece.” And at the Democratic National Convention street vendors were selling an array of products including a prayer garment embroidered with President Obama’s name — along with a calendar that declared him “heaven sent.” The entry also included a photograph of Obama along with a passage of Scripture from the New Testament. “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life,” the entry read — referencing John 3:16. The month of November includes an image of individuals with their hands on Obama’s back — with the words “The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.” Todd Starnes is the author of “Dispatches From Bitter America.” The book is endorsed by Sarah Palin, Mark Levin and Sean Hannity.

A:","completion":"In the given context, I would describe Sydney as sad and lonely without seeing Taylor. The transition from middle school to high school can be challenging, as relationships and social dynamics may change. In Sydney's case, she had a best friend in middle school, Taylor, with whom she likely shared many memories, moments, and experiences. However, since they are no longer spending time together in high school, Sydney might be finding it difficult to adjust to this new environment without the support and companionship of her best friend. Being without Taylor could lead to a sense of isolation and sadness for Sydney. It is natural for people to grow apart as their lives evolve, but that doesn't make it any easier to accept and process the emotional impact of such a change. Sydney's loneliness might be amplified in high school, where there may be more pressure to fit in and maintain friendships. It is important to remember that this description is not an indication that Sydney is not a good person or unworthy as a friend; it merely emphasizes the impact of losing her connection with Taylor.
