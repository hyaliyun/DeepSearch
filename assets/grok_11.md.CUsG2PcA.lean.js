There was debate between the realists and the nominalists over the concept of universals.

Scholars such as Peter Abelard (d. 1142) and Peter Lombard (d. 1164) introduced Aristotelian logic into theology. In the late 11th and early 12th centuries cathedral schools spread throughout Western Europe, signalling the shift of learning from monasteries to cathedrals and towns. Cathedral schools were in turn replaced by the universities established in major European cities. Philosophy and theology fused in scholasticism, an attempt by 12th and 13thcentury scholars to reconcile authoritative texts, most notably Aristotle and the Bible.

The findings suggest that those who spend more than 900 hours working in industries, such as telecommunications or electrical engineering, are at an increased risk of developing brain tumours. The research, which spans a period of almost a decade, has analysed data from more than 2500 patients diagnosed with brain tumours. The patients were then compared with control groups to assess the effect of various risk factors, including occupational exposure. According to the study, those who spent more than 15 years working in the aforementioned industries, were twice as likely to develop meningiomas, which is a type of brain tumour. Additionally, the research found a link between these exposures and gliomas, which are tumours arising from the brain's glial cells. The results of the research have led to calls for increased regulation to protect workers from occupational hazards within industries such as telecommunications and electrical engineering. A French pressure group has called for tougher regulations to minimise workers' prolonged exposure to electromagnetic fields and protect their health. In conclusion, this study highlights the need for further research into the potential risks of prolonged exposure to electromagnetic fields in the workplace.

If preeclampsia is suspected, your physician will recommend further testing, such as blood tests and ultrasounds, to monitor the health of you and your baby. If you experience any symptoms of preeclampsia, such as severe headaches, shortness of breath, or visual changes, it is crucial to seek medical attention immediately. Early diagnosis and management of preeclampsia can help prevent serious complications, such as seizures, premature birth, or low birth weight. Your doctor will recommend certain lifestyle changes, such as limiting salt intake and getting enough rest, to manage symptoms of preeclampsia. In some cases, medication may be prescribed to lower blood pressure and prevent further complications. In conclusion, if you are pregnant, it is important to attend regular prenatal visits and watch for any symptoms of preeclampsia. If you do experience symptoms, seek medical attention right away.

Make copies of your forms. File the forms with your county clerk.","completion":"Domestic violence is a serious issue that affects millions of people every year. If you're experiencing domestic violence, it's important to know that you have options to protect yourself and your family. One of the most effective steps you can take is to obtain a restraining order against your abuser. One important thing to consider is supervised visitation. If you have children with your abuser, it may be necessary for your children to still have contact with their other parent under certain circumstances. However, if you fear for your children's safety, it's important to ask for supervised visitation. This means that a neutral third-party will be present during visits to ensure that your children are safe and that the terms of the restraining order are not violated. To obtain a domestic violence restraining order, you will need to fill out a form. The form may differ slightly depending on your state, but generally, you will need to provide information about the abuse you have experienced and why you need the restraining order. If you're not sure what to include, there are resources available to help you. You can contact your local domestic violence organization or speak with an attorney who specializes in domestic violence cases. Once you've completed the form, it's important to have it reviewed by someone who is familiar with the process. This may be an attorney or a domestic violence advocate. They can ensure that you've included all necessary information and that you've filled out the form correctly. It's also important to make copies of your forms. You'll need to file the original form with your county clerk, but having copies for your records and to give to your attorney can be helpful. Finally, you'll need to file the form with your county clerk. This may involve waiting in line and paying a fee. Once your form has been filed, the clerk will provide you with a court date. At the hearing, you'll have the opportunity to present evidence of the abuse you've suffered and request the restraining order be granted. In conclusion, if you're experiencing domestic violence, obtaining a restraining order can help protect you and your family. Consider supervised visitation if you have children with your abuser, and make sure to fill out the restraining order form correctly, have it reviewed, make copies, and file it with your county clerk. Remember, you're not alone and there are resources available to help you."},{"prompt":"when did the iconic trump tower open its doors??","completion":"Trump Tower opened its doors on November 30, 1983."},{"prompt":"Given the fact electrical current running through a wire causes that wire to heat up, what is the answer to the question or completion If electrical current is running OPTIONS: the wire may be hot to the touch the wire may be cool to the touch the wire is automatically grounded the wire is automatically water safe","completion":"If electrical current is running, the wire may be hot to the touch."},{"prompt":"Sentence 1: Geographically , the NDP campaign focused on seats in Scarborough and Etobicoke in Toronto , Hamilton , Ottawa , and North Ontario .

He blamed him for splitting the vote in election for Norfolk County Council. Gardiner fined £475 after being convicted of threatening behaviour. He is refusing to resign and insists he has 'no regrets about the incident.","completion":"Andrew Gardiner, a town councillor from Norfolk County, recently made the news after launching a tirade against fellow councillor Mike Weston. Gardiner accused Weston of splitting the vote in a recent election for the Norfolk County Council, and his outburst resulted in a conviction for threatening behavior and a fine of £475. Despite the clear evidence against him, Gardiner is refusing to resign from his position and has expressed no remorse for his actions. This kind of behavior is unacceptable from an elected official, who should be held to a higher standard of conduct than the average citizen. It is unclear what Gardiner hopes to achieve by refusing to step down, but it is clear that he is not acting in the best interests of his constituents. Allowing him to remain in office sends the message that his behavior is acceptable, which could have serious consequences for the community he represents. The fact that Gardiner has no regrets about his outburst is particularly troubling. It shows a lack of accountability and speaks to a larger issue of entitlement among some elected officials. It is not enough to simply apologize for bad behavior; elected officials must be held to account and take responsibility for their actions. In a time when political discourse has become increasingly divisive and nasty, it is more important than ever to hold elected officials to a higher standard of behavior. Andrew Gardiner's refusal to resign and lack of remorse for his actions is a stain on the reputation of the Norfolk County Council and a disservice to the people he represents. It is time for him to step down and take responsibility for his actions."},{"prompt":"Write a positive movie review.","completion":"This movie was truly amazing!

Speak up. Support the person without enabling. Avoid approaches likely to cause additional conflict. Determine if the person is ready for treatment. Assist with finding a therapy to which the person responds. Look into treatment facilities. Look into group treatment options. Watch for signs of relapse. Have patience. Avoid selfblame. Take care of yourself.","completion":"Supporting a loved one who is struggling with addiction can be a difficult and emotionally draining experience. It's important to understand that recovery is a process that takes time, effort, and support. Here are some guidelines to help you navigate this journey successfully. Firstly, it's important to know what to expect when supporting someone with addiction. It's not a simple matter of telling them to stop using drugs or alcohol. Addiction is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach involving therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes. Secondly, don't be afraid to speak up. Let your loved one know that you're there for them and that you support them. Be supportive without enabling them, which means not giving them money or covering up for them. Thirdly, try to avoid approaches that are likely to cause additional conflict. Confrontation and blame are typically not helpful in supporting someone through addiction. Instead, try to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. Fourthly, determine if the person is ready for treatment. Pushing someone into recovery before they're ready can be counterproductive. Encourage them to seek help, but ultimately it's up to them to make the decision to get clean. Fifthly, assist with finding a therapy to which the person responds. There are many different types of therapy, and what works for one person may not work for another. Help your loved one find a therapist and approach that they feel comfortable with. Sixthly, consider treatment facilities. Residential treatment centers can provide intensive support and structure for those struggling with addiction. Seventhly, group therapy can also be a helpful option. Support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous can provide a supportive community for those in recovery. Eighthly, watch for signs of relapse. Recovery is a process, and setbacks can happen. Be supportive and encouraging while also being aware of warning signs. Ninthly, have patience. Recovery is not a quick fix, and it can take time for your loved one to fully recover. Be patient and compassionate. Tenthly, avoid self-blame. It's not your fault that your loved one is struggling with addiction. Focus on providing support and love rather than blaming yourself. Lastly, take care of yourself. Supporting someone with addiction can be emotionally draining, so make sure you take care of yourself as well. Seek out support groups and therapy if necessary. Overall, supporting someone through addiction requires patience, understanding, and support. Keep these guidelines in mind as you navigate this challenging but ultimately rewarding journey."},{"prompt":"Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? , and unforgettable characters OPTIONS: negative positive","completion":"Positive."},{"prompt":"&lt; Tired of elementary tricks on twitter.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. Among the challenges being faced to improve the efficiency of LEDbased white light sources is the development of more efficient phosphors. As of 2010, the most efficient yellow phosphor is still the YAG phosphor, with less than 10% Stoke shift loss.

Allow the skin tear to air dry.","completion":"Skin tears are a common injury that can occur in people of all ages, and it is important to take proper care of these wounds to prevent infection and promote healing. The first step in caring for a skin tear is to wash the wound with warm water. This will help to remove any dirt or debris that may be present on the skin and reduce the risk of infection. After washing the skin tear, it is important to use a saline wound cleanser to further clean the wound. Saline solutions are commonly used in wound care because they are gentle on the skin and do not cause irritation. To use a saline wound cleanser, simply apply the solution to the wound and gently rub it in with a clean cloth or gauze. This will help to remove any remaining debris and ensure that the wound is clean. Once the skin tear has been cleaned, it is important to allow it to air dry. This may take a few minutes, but it is important to avoid using a towel or other cloth to dry the wound, as this can cause further damage to the skin. Allowing the skin tear to air dry will also help to prevent the growth of bacteria and promote faster healing. In addition to washing the skin tear, using a saline wound cleanser, and allowing the wound to air dry, it is also important to keep the area clean and covered with a sterile bandage or dressing. This will help to protect the wound from further damage and reduce the risk of infection. Overall, caring for a skin tear is a simple process that can be done at home with a few basic supplies. By washing the wound with warm water, using a saline wound cleanser, and allowing the wound to air dry, you can help to promote healing and prevent the onset of infection.

FA are in the dock for way they went about trying to host 2018 World Cup. FA appear stupid at best, dodgy at worst after trying to court Jack Warner. Locals are trying to save the Sir Alf Ramsey pub in Tunbridge Wells.","completion":"The English Football Association (FA) has long prided itself on its moral integrity and upstanding behavior. However, recent events surrounding their attempts to host the 2018 World Cup have tarnished this once-sterling reputation. The FA has now found themselves in the dock, facing accusations of impropriety and disingenuousness in their bid to land the World Cup. In particular, their attempts to curry favor with controversial FIFA figure Jack Warner have raised eyebrows both at home and abroad. At best, the FA's behavior can be described as foolish and naive. At worst, it reeks of something more insidious. Regardless of their intentions, the damage has been done, and the FA's claim to moral high ground has been irreparably damaged. In the midst of this scandal, some grassroots efforts have arisen to try and preserve local traditions. One such example is the campaign to save the Sir Alf Ramsey pub in Tunbridge Wells. Named after the legendary England football manager, the pub has become a well-loved local institution. However, it is now under threat, as developers look to turn it into flats. The campaign to save the pub is perhaps a glimmer of hope in an otherwise grim situation. It represents a rallying cry for those who value tradition, community, and local identity. In the face of the FA's moral failings, it serves as a reminder that there are still things worth fighting for. Overall, the FA's fall from grace is a cautionary tale about the dangers of hubris and complacency. It's a reminder that no one - not even the most powerful institutions - is immune to scandal and corruption. The challenge now is for the FA to rebuild its reputation and regain the trust of its fans and supporters."},{"prompt":"Question: How many kindergarten classes were there?

Finished.","completion":"Pork rinds are a popular snack that can be enjoyed at home with friends and family. However, preparing them can be tricky if you are not accustomed to frying. To start, heat some oil or lard in a frying pan. It's important to use a pan with high edges to prevent oil splattering. Allow the oil or lard to heat up until it reaches a temperature of 375°F. You can use a thermometer to ensure it has reached the correct temperature. Before adding the pork skins to the frying pan, it's worth testing the heat of the oil or lard. You can do this by dropping a small piece of pork rind into the oil or lard. If it starts to sizzle immediately, the oil or lard is ready. Once the oil or lard is at the right temperature, you can add the pork skins to the frying pan. Fry them until they become golden and puffy. This should take around 3-5 minutes. It's important to monitor them closely as they can burn quickly. Once the pork rinds are ready, remove them from the frying pan and allow them to cool for a few minutes. Once they are cool, season them with your choice of spices such as salt, paprika or pepper. You can also try different spice combinations to create your own unique flavor. As for storing leftover pork rinds, place them in an airtight container or a ziplock bag. They can last for several days at room temperature but will stay fresher longer if kept in the refrigerator. In conclusion, frying pork rinds may seem daunting at first, but it's a simple process that can lead to a delicious snack. Remember to test the oil or lard before adding the pork skins, fry until golden and puffy, season with your favorite spices and store leftovers properly.

Speaking at a social mobility conference in London, Dr Cable argued that many jobs only required the skills and knowledge that could be taught on the job or through vocational training, rather than a university degree. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is encouraging professions to re-evaluate the qualifications required for certain jobs in order to promote social mobility and make the job market more accessible. By lowering the barrier to entry for these jobs, individuals from diverse backgrounds and without higher education qualifications would have a better chance to progress their careers. Dr Cable's comments have been seen as a response to growing concerns about the UK's social mobility stagnation, with the job market increasingly demanding highly qualified candidates for even more basic positions. By making a concerted effort to reassess the types of qualifications necessary for many jobs, the government hopes to provide more opportunities for those with alternate skill sets or those who did not pursue higher education. However, Dr Cable also acknowledged that some professions would still require a degree, such as those in medicine, engineering, or law. Nevertheless, this shift in attitude towards degree requirements will likely be welcomed by many who have been discouraged from pursuing certain career paths due to the high cost of higher education or who have lacked the means to acquire a degree. In the long term, it is hoped that this change will help to increase social mobility and create a more diverse and accessible job market for individuals from all walks of life. Businesses and professions will need to be willing to adapt their hiring practices in order to realize these benefits, but the potential rewards for creating a more equitable job market are significant."},{"prompt":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: duck, flock, food","completion":"The flock of ducks eagerly gathered around the food."},{"prompt":"Q: Who runs Guam's main health care facility?

It was West Saxon that formed the basis for the literary standard of the later Old English period, although the dominant forms of Middle and Modern English would develop mainly from Mercian.

However, some possible insights can be gleaned from historical records and scholarship. In general, exiles were individuals who had been banished from their home countries or regions due to political, religious, or other reasons. In some cases, they may have been forced to work in labor camps or other types of penal institutions. Guards and overseers, on the other hand, were typically employed by the authorities to manage and maintain order in such institutions. One key factor that may affect the ratio of exiles to guards and overseers is the nature of the labor being performed. For example, if the labor is highly skilled or specialized, there may be fewer workers overall but a higher ratio of overseers to workers. Conversely, if the labor is more manual and repetitive, there may be a larger number of workers and fewer overseers. Another factor that could impact the ratio of exiles to guards and overseers is the political climate of the time period in question. In some historical contexts, ruling authorities may have sought to maintain strict control over the population and therefore employed a larger number of guards and overseers relative to the number of exiles. In other cases, however, dissent and rebellion may have been more prevalent, leading to a higher number of exiles and a larger need for guards and overseers to maintain order. Overall, it is difficult to make a definitive statement about whether there were fewer workers among exiles or guards and overseers, as the specifics of each context could vary widely. Perhaps a more fruitful line of inquiry would be to examine the experiences and conditions of these workers more closely, in order to better understand the ways in which power, oppression, and resistance operate within systems of institutionalized labor."},{"prompt":"w does this story end?

This time, he has taken aim at former President Barack Obama, calling him a 'sore winner.' According to the former politician, Obama's failure to embrace bipartisanship is the root cause of the current political discord in the United States. The idea of bipartisanship is not new. It is the concept of working together across party lines to achieve common goals. It is an ideal that politicians from both sides of the aisle have pledged to uphold for decades. However, in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to achieve. Many blame the current level of polarization on former President Obama. According to his critics, he was unwilling to work with Republicans, instead preferring to push through his agenda by executive order. This, they argue, set the stage for the current atmosphere of mistrust and division. Coming from an experienced politician, these comments are significant. It suggests that even those within the Democratic Party are beginning to challenge the administration's approach to governance. It also highlights the growing rift between the two factions of the party. Senator's comments on gun-control laws are equally controversial. He believes that the government should not pass laws that infringe on the Second Amendment rights of Americans. This is a position that is bound to be unpopular with many progressive voters. Overall, the comments made by the former Senator and Presidential hopeful are sure to spark debate. They bring to light some of the challenges facing the United States as it tries to move forward. While opinions may be sharply divided on these issues, it is clear that something needs to change if the government is to be more effective in meeting the needs of its citizens."},{"prompt":"Solve 0 = 3295849*o 3295812*o 3145 for o.","completion":"0=3295849o-3295812o-3145 can be simplified as 37o = 3145.

They can be carriers of diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, and Zika virus. Eliminating or reducing the mosquito population in your yard is essential for your family's health and enjoyment of outdoor activities. Here are some tips and tricks to make your yard a mosquito-free zone. 1. Eliminate or Fill Nooks, Crannies, and Holes: Mosquitoes can breed in small pockets of stagnant water. Fill in any holes in your yard or cover them up to eliminate potential breeding sites. 2. Mow Your Lawns Weekly: Keeping your lawn mowed and short can help reduce the number of mosquitoes in your yard. Mosquitoes prefer longer grass as it provides them shelter. 3. Trim Back Tall Weeds and Bushes: Mosquitoes prefer to rest in the shade and higher areas. Be sure to trim back any tall weeds or bushes to make your yard less hospitable for mosquitoes. 4. Plant Mosquito-Repelling Flowers and Herbs: Some plants are known to naturally repel mosquitoes. Consider planting lavender, marigolds, or citronella in your yard. 5. Get Some Fish for Your Water Garden: Certain fish, such as mosquitofish, feed on mosquito larvae. Adding these fish to your water garden can help reduce the mosquito population. 6. Add a Waterfall, Fountain, or Aerator to Your Water Garden: Mosquitoes prefer still water for breeding. Installing a fountain or aerator in your water garden can help keep the water moving, making it less attractive to mosquitoes. 7. Make Use of Larvicides: Larvicides, a type of pesticide that targets mosquito larvae can be used in areas where water cannot be eliminated or altered. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully and avoid using it in areas with fish or other aquatic life. 8. Encourage Other Mosquito Predators to Visit Your Yard: Bats, birds, and dragonflies are natural mosquito predators. Encouraging them to visit your yard can help reduce the mosquito population. In conclusion, these eight tips and tricks can help you eliminate or reduce mosquitoes in your yard. Mosquitoes can be a significant threat to your family's health and can ruin your outdoor experiences. By following these simple measures and being diligent about maintaining your yard, you can make your yard a mosquito-free zone."},{"prompt":"We went this past year and it was really nice.

On Friday, the Coast Guard cautioned boaters against the lower Lake Michigan temperatures.","completion":"Michigan Residents Should Prepare for a Colder Winter Due to Lower Great Lakes Temperatures Winter may arrive earlier than usual for Michigan residents this year. This can be attributed to the lower surface temperatures of Lake Superior and Lake Michigan, both of which have seen a drop of 6.1 degrees in their average temperature last week. As a result, Michigan residents may want to start bundling up sooner to prepare for the chilly weather which may linger throughout November and December. The cooler temperatures also mean that the lakes may ice up sooner than expected. This may be problematic to boaters, as the Coast Guard advised on Friday of the lower temperatures especially in Lake Michigan. Michigan residents who are used to milder winters may want to take extra precaution and prepare for the colder climate in the upcoming months. It's important to make sure homes are properly insulated, and have sufficient heating systems installed to keep the indoors warm and cozy during the low temperatures. Overall, Michigan residents should take note of the drop in lake temperature as a warning sign to prepare for the winter ahead."},{"prompt":"Based on the premise yeah yeah hm i i think um you know we're able to read each other pretty well because uh she knows when i'm upset and i know when she's not feeling good too so i know like when she has an accident i know she's not doing it on purpose, can we conclude the hypothesis I think we know each other well. is true?

Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran Microsoft Windows NT on Intel chips, and could be built cheaper than its competitors. Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13 percent of the company's total intake by 1998. Three years later, Dell passed Compaq as the top provider of Intelbased servers, with 31 percent of the market. Dell's first acquisition occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies for 332 million, after Dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage system inhouse; ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with Dell's commodityproducer business model, forcing Dell to write down the entire value of the acquisition.","completion":"Title: Dell's Expansion into Enterprise Servers and Acquisition Challenges"},{"prompt":"Sara: gimme once again Andrea's number, pls Josh: v card sent.

Careful pruning and handling of the branch is important to ensure that the cutting takes root properly. The first step is to prepare a shallow hole in the ground, burying the middle of the branch into the soil. It's important to anchor the branch in place to keep it upright and prevent it from moving around as it takes root. Once the branch is in place, keep it moist by watering it regularly, making sure the soil stays damp but not waterlogged.

You can check on its progress by gently digging up the branch and inspecting the roots. Once you see that the branch has developed enough roots to sustain itself, you can cut it off from the established plant and transplant it as a new lavender plant.

Farmers continued to dislike DST, and many countries repealed it after the war. Britain was an exception: it retained DST nationwide but over the years adjusted transition dates for several reasons, including special rules during the 1920s and 1930s to avoid clock shifts on Easter mornings. The US was more typical: Congress repealed DST after 1919. President Woodrow Wilson, like Willett an avid golfer, vetoed the repeal twice but his second veto was overridden. Only a few US cities retained DST locally thereafter, including New York so that its financial exchanges could maintain an hour of arbitrage trading with London, and Chicago and Cleveland to keep pace with New York. Wilson's successor Warren G. Harding opposed DST as a deception. Reasoning that people should instead get up and go to work earlier in the summer, he ordered District of Columbia federal employees to start work at 08:00 rather than 09:00 during summer 1922. Some businesses followed suit though many others did not; the experiment was not repeated.

The Japanese victory occurred a mere three decades after the Meiji Restoration set a feudal Japan on course to emulate the Western nations in their economic and technological achievements. Finally, in December 1894, the Qing government took concrete steps to reform military institutions and to retrain selected units in westernized drills, tactics and weaponry. These units were collectively called the New Army.

Webber's rendition will undoubtedly add a new layer of excitement to this well-loved story. However, \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" isn't the only project on Webber's mind. In fact, his long-running musical \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" just celebrated its 25th anniversary this year. This remarkable achievement is a testament to the enduring appeal of Webber's music and his ability to create shows that capture the hearts of viewers across generations. Interestingly, one of Webber's most famous songs from the musical \\"Jesus Christ Superstar,\\" \\"I Don't Know How to Love Him,\\" wasn't originally named as such.

If you're looking for inspiration to create your own shape poem, analyzing examples can be a great starting point. Take the time to read and study different shape poems, paying attention to how words are arranged and how they interact with the shape of the image. Once you've spent some time with examples, it's time to focus on your own interests. Whether it's a hobby, an activity, or something that brings you joy, start exploring how you can express these ideas through a shape poem. Maybe you enjoy painting and want to create a poem in the shape of a paintbrush, or perhaps you're a runner and want to create a poem in the shape of a running shoe. Nature can be an excellent source of inspiration, too. Take a walk outside and observe the shapes of the natural world. From the curve of a tree branch to the shape of a bird in flight, there are countless ways that nature can inspire you to create a unique and meaningful shape poem. Finally, consider using an object of sentimental value as the basis for your poem. Maybe it's a cherished piece of jewelry, a nostalgic toy from your childhood, or a memento from a special trip. Use the shape of the object to guide your poem, allowing the words to flow and inspire the final shape of the image. With a little bit of inspiration and creative energy, you can create your own shape poem that reflects your unique style and interests.

If identity is a kind of virtual site in which the dynamic processes and markers used for identification are made apparent, boundaries provide the framework on which this virtual site is built.

These chemical herbicides work by inhibiting the growth of the plant, eventually leading to its death. While some people have concerns about the safety and environmental impact of glyphosate, it remains a popular and effective option for weed control. One way to maximize the effectiveness of these products is by applying them several times over the course of a growing season. This can help to ensure that even weeds that have already begun to grow are eliminated before they have a chance to seed and spread. Additionally, repeated applications can help to target different stages of growth, ensuring that the herbicide is effective against both young and mature plants. While chemical herbicides are effective, they are not the only option for controlling weeds. Organic weed-control methods can also be used in conjunction with glyphosate and similar products. One approach is to use mechanical methods, such as hand weeding or hoeing, to remove weeds manually. Another option is to use organic herbicides, made from natural ingredients like vinegar or citric acid. By combining chemical and organic weed control methods, property owners can achieve the best of both worlds. Glyphosate and similar products can help to effectively eliminate unwanted plant growth, while organic methods can help to minimize the use of potentially harmful chemicals. When used correctly and in combination, these methods can help to keep gardens and agricultural fields healthy and free of weeds."},{"prompt":"Generate a sentence that includes all the following words: bathroom, contain, toilet, wall","completion":"The bathroom wall contains the toilet."},{"prompt":"midation and violence against women continues \`\` unabated '' in posttaliban afghanistan , but they have greater access to education and employment , a u.n. report says .

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"A fascinating experiment conducted by New York psychologist Arthur Aron in 1997 has recently gone viral, after a New York Times columnist tried it out and confirmed its effectiveness. In the experiment, Aron made strangers fall in love by asking them a series of 36 questions. The questions are designed to progressively become more intense and personal, encouraging the participants to open up to one another and develop a deeper connection. The questions start off innocuously enough, asking things like \\"What would constitute a perfect day for you?\\" and \\"Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die?\\". However, they gradually become more probing, asking things like \\"When did you last cry in front of another person?\\" and \\"Is there something that you've dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven't you done it?\\". The idea behind the experiment is that by answering these questions honestly and vulnerably, the participants will start to feel a sense of intimacy and closeness with each other that could potentially lead to romantic feelings. While the experiment was originally conducted in a lab setting, the New York Times columnist who recently tried it out did so on a date with a virtual stranger, and reported that they felt a strong connection afterwards. So, if you're looking to fall in love yourself, why not give the 36 questions a try? While there are no guarantees that they'll work for everyone, they certainly seem to have a good track record so far.

With this information, the calculation is relatively straightforward. Assuming the total population of the city is known, the first step is to determine the number of individuals who are 65 years of age or older. This can be achieved by accessing census data or other demographic information that provides a breakdown of age cohorts within the population. Once the number of individuals who are 65 years of age or older is known, the next step is to subtract this number from the total population of the city. The resulting figure represents the number of individuals who are younger than 65 years of age. To calculate the percentage of individuals who are not 65 years of age or older, the number of individuals who are younger than 65 years of age should be divided by the total population of the city. This value should then be multiplied by 100 to convert the figure to a percentage. For example, if a city has a total population of 100,000 and 20,000 of those individuals are 65 years of age or older, the calculation to determine the percentage of individuals who are not 65 years of age or older is as follows: 100,000 - 20,000 = 80,000 80,000 ÷ 100,000 = 0.8 0.8 x 100 = 80% Therefore, in this example, 80% of the city's population is not 65 years of age or older.

This was first developed to help launch STOVL aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A skijump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a skijump launching fully loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea.

The usual design is that the camera's parameters for interpreting the sensor data values into sRGB values are fixed, and a number of different EI choices are accommodated by varying the sensor's signal gain in the analog realm, prior to conversion to digital. Some camera designs provide at least some EI choices by adjusting the sensor's signal gain in the digital realm. A few camera designs also provide EI adjustment through a choice of lightness parameters for the interpretation of sensor data values into sRGB; this variation allows different tradeoffs between the range of highlights that can be captured and the amount of noise introduced into the shadow areas of the photo.

The motivational clip shows Depay working out and training hard, and it's clear that he is fully committed to reaching his full potential. Depay has also caught the eye of Holland manager Guus Hiddink, who has praised his ability and potential. Hiddink believes that Depay could become Holland's best player in the near future, which is high praise indeed considering the country's rich footballing history. It remains to be seen which club will ultimately secure Depay's services, but one thing is certain: the young winger has the talent and drive to become a star at the highest level, and it will be exciting to see where his career takes him in the coming years."},{"prompt":"What is the answer to this question? when did ju ju on that beat come out?","completion":"The song \\"Juju on That Beat\\" was released on September 30, 2016."},{"prompt":"What is the sentiment of the following review?

Bartomeu believes Pep Guardiola will one day return to the club. He says Luis Suarez does not have a no biting clause.","completion":"Barcelona President Admits Difficult Year Barcelona's recent history has been plagued with controversy, and it seems that the club's current president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, is well aware of the difficulties his tenure has brought. Speaking in a recent interview, Bartomeu acknowledged that the past year has been \\"very difficult\\" for the club, and that he has faced some significant challenges in his role. One of the most significant issues Bartomeu has faced is the ongoing fallout from allegations of corruption and wrongdoing at the club. In recent years, Barcelona has been accused of various misdemeanours, including the manipulation of player contracts, tax fraud, and illegal activity in the transfer market. While the club has vehemently denied all of these allegations, they have still had a significant impact on the reputation of both the team and its management. Despite these difficulties, Bartomeu remains optimistic about the future of the club. In particular, he believes that former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola will one day return to the team. Guardiola is widely regarded as one of the greatest coaches of all time, and he has previously led Barcelona to unprecedented success during his four-year reign at the club. Bartomeu believes that Guardiola's return is a matter of when, not if. Perhaps surprisingly, Bartomeu also made headlines recently when he revealed that Barcelona striker Luis Suarez does not have a \\"no biting\\" clause in his contract. This revelation comes after Suarez was involved in a number of high-profile biting incidents in recent years, including the infamous 2014 World Cup incident where he bit Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini. While this news may come as a surprise to some, it is just one of many challenges that Bartomeu and his team have had to face during their tenure at Barcelona. Despite the difficulties they have faced, however, the president remains committed to the future success of the club, and he has vowed to do everything in his power to ensure that the team continues to be one of the best in the world."},{"prompt":"Would the answer to the question What terrorist group was headed by Donald DeFreeze ? be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?

For example, with Robert D. Richtmyer he developed an algorithm defining artificial viscosity that improved the understanding of shock waves. A problem was that when computers solved hydrodynamic or aerodynamic problems, they tried to put too many computational grid points at regions of sharp discontinuity (shock waves). The mathematics of artificial viscosity smoothed the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics.

These laws helped establish the Church of England and cemented the power of the monarchy in English politics. The first of the Six Statutes, the Act of Supremacy, was passed in 1534. This law declared that the king was the supreme head of the Church of England, replacing the authority of the pope. The Act of Supremacy was followed by the Act of Succession, which established the order of succession to the English throne, and the Treasons Act, which made it a crime to deny the king's authority. In 1536, the government passed the Act of Use of Welsh Language, which banned the use of Welsh in legal proceedings and official documents. This law was aimed at assimilating Wales into English culture and language. The remaining two statutes, the Act for the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries and the Act for the Dissolution of the Greater Monasteries, were both passed in 1539. These laws dissolved religious orders and confiscated their property, which helped fill the royal coffers and break the power of the Catholic Church in England. In total, the Six Statutes were passed over a period of five years, from 1534 to 1539. This was a time of great political and religious upheaval in England, as the Tudor dynasty sought to establish its authority and break the power of the Catholic Church. The Six Statutes were a key part of this process, and their legacy can still be seen in the modern-day Church of England and the power of the monarchy in British politics."},{"prompt":"Keywords: change, life, nothing What is a sentence that includes all these keywords?","completion":"Nothing will change in your life if you don't take action."},{"prompt":"What is the solution?
