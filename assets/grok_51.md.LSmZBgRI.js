It was characterized by a handful of large, vertically integrated studios that controlled all aspects of a film’s production, from financing to casting to distribution. However, beginning in the 1950s, the system began to fragment due to various factors, including the decline of the movie-going experience and the rise of television, which led to a drop in revenue for the studios. Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were part of a new wave of American filmmakers who emerged in the 1970s and challenged the dominance of the studio system. They saw an opportunity in the rise of independent filmmaking and began creating movies that showcased their own artistic visions rather than relying on the traditional studio model. This period of artistic experimentation in film gave rise to some of the most iconic movies of the late 20th century. While the work of Spielberg, Lucas, and others helped to usher in a new era of cinema, it also contributed to the decline of the studio system. By the 1980s, the business of making movies had become increasingly decentralized, with smaller production companies and independent filmmakers gaining more leverage in the industry. Studios began relying more heavily on blockbusters and franchises to drive revenue, which further eroded their control over the filmmaking process. Today, the studio system in Hollywood is vastly different from what it was during its heyday.

The new era of independent filmmaking, and the legacy of filmmakers like Spielberg and Lucas, have forever transformed the way movies are made and consumed."},{"prompt":"What role does music play in different cultures?","completion":"Music plays a significant role in different cultures, serving as a means of expression, communication, storytelling, religious or spiritual practice, social bonding, entertainment, and even healing."},{"prompt":"What is the historical connection between the Austrian nobility and the Habsburg family?","completion":"The Austrian nobility was closely connected to the Habsburg family through a long history of intermarriage, political alliances, and patronage.

RTKs are transmembrane proteins that activate intracellular signaling pathways through the transfer of a phosphate group to tyrosine residues on their intracellular domains. This initiates a signaling cascade that ultimately leads to changes in gene expression or cellular behavior. GPCRs, on the other hand, activate intracellular signaling pathways through interaction with G proteins, which in turn activate secondary messengers such as cyclic AMP, leading to downstream signaling events. In terms of specificity, RTKs typically bind specific ligands, such as growth factors, while GPCRs are more promiscuous in their ligand binding, responding to a wide variety of stimuli from neurotransmitters to hormones. RTK signaling tends to be more focused and targeted than GPCR signaling. Finally, RTKs are often associated with cell growth and proliferation, while GPCRs often regulate physiological processes such as cardiovascular function and neurotransmission."},{"prompt":"What are the political implications of being a landlocked country in the modern era?","completion":"Political implications of being a landlocked country in the modern era include limited access to trade routes and ports, increased transportation costs, and greater dependence on neighboring countries for imports and exports.

It is the process of converting waste materials into new products, which helps in conserving resources and reducing pollution. Despite the benefits of recycling, many people still do not recycle enough. Therefore, we must encourage people to recycle more for several reasons. Firstly, recycling reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, which is essential because landfills are hazardous to the environment. Landfills contain large amounts of harmful chemicals, and when trash is dumped into landfills, the chemicals can pose a threat to our health and environment. Recycling can help to minimize the amount of waste in landfills and thus reduce the negative consequences they cause. Secondly, recycling uses fewer resources and energy compared to producing new products from raw materials. When waste materials are recycled, the production of new products requires fewer resources and energy. This helps conserve natural resources such as water and minerals, and also helps reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. Lastly, recycling has economic benefits. Recycling creates jobs, promotes local economies, and saves money by reducing the costs of waste disposal. Through recycling, we can lessen the need for landfills and incineration, which are expensive and often harm the environment. In conclusion, recycling plays a significant role in protecting our planet's environment and should be promoted to a higher level. As individuals, it's our responsibility to recycle more and encourage others to do so. We must embrace sustainable practices to protect our planet and ensure a better future for generations to come."},{"prompt":"What are some traditional Colombian dishes that are a musttry?","completion":"Traditional Colombian dishes that are a must-try include bandeja paisa, ajiaco, sancocho, arepas, lechona, and empanadas."},{"prompt":"What barriers did women aviators face when trying to enter the field of aviation?","completion":"Women aviators faced a variety of barriers including lack of access to flight training, prejudice and discrimination from male aviators and potential employers, and societal beliefs about gender roles and abilities."},{"prompt":"What is the significance of the Protestant Reformation in British history?","completion":"The Protestant Reformation had a significant impact on British history as it led to the establishment of the Church of England and the breakaway from the authority of the Roman Catholic Church.

X-ray crystallography involves shining X-rays onto a crystal of the molecule of interest and analyzing the resulting diffraction pattern to determine the positions of atoms within the molecule. This technique is widely used because X-rays easily penetrate most materials and because the diffraction pattern provides a high degree of resolution. However, X-rays interact primarily with the electron cloud around atoms, and thus they provide little information about the positions of hydrogen atoms. Neutron crystallography uses neutrons instead of X-rays. Neutrons interact with atomic nuclei rather than the electron cloud, so they can provide information about hydrogen atoms, which are usually difficult to see using X-rays. However, neutron sources are much less powerful than X-ray sources, so neutron crystallography requires much larger and more perfect crystals than X-ray crystallography. Additionally, the neutron beam can damage the crystals and cause unwanted chemical changes, and certain molecules may not be amenable to neutron analysis. In summary, while both techniques are powerful tools for determining molecular structures, X-ray crystallography is often more widely applicable due to the greater availability and ease of use of X-ray sources, while neutron crystallography can provide additional information about the positions of hydrogen atoms."},{"prompt":"w did Persian literature influence the development of Islamic philosophy?","completion":"Persian literature influenced Islamic philosophy by contributing to the development of mystical and spiritual concepts and themes, such as love and self-realization, which were incorporated into Islamic philosophical works.

The signals are transmitted as radio waves, using a specific frequency range that is reserved for communication between spacecraft and Earth. This frequency range is known as the deep space network or DSN. The communication system on a spacecraft utilizes directional antennas to focus the radio signals towards Earth. These antennas are usually high-gain and parabolic in shape. Information is transmitted in the form of digital signals, which can be easily processed and decoded by computers. For data transmission, the information is first encoded into a format that is optimized for transmission over radio waves. This format is usually in the form of binary code, which consists of 0s and 1s. The binary data is then modulated onto a carrier wave, which is then transmitted through the spacecraft's transmitter. On the receiving end, the signals are picked up by an antenna on Earth and then fed into a receiver that is designed to extract the digital data from the signal. Once the data is extracted, it is then processed and decoded by computers and made available for analysis and study by scientists and engineers."},{"prompt":"w can you optimize fuel efficiency for a group of trucks on delivery routes?","completion":"To optimize fuel efficiency for a group of trucks on delivery routes, you can consider the following steps: 1.

Experiment with harmony: Armenian folk songs often have simple harmonies, but you can experiment with different chord progressions to make your song unique. 7. Refine and practice: Once you have composed your song, refine it and practice performing it until you are satisfied with the final product. By following these steps, you can compose a song that captures the essence of Armenian folk music."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},B={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],D={key:0},H={key:1};function j(n,e,l,p,o,s){const u=g("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",B,[(i(!0),a(b,null,w(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(i(),k(u,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",q,' No results found for "'+h(o.searchQuery)+'".
